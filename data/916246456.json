This assessment and review of mental health symptoms will help influence and underpin the wellness recovery action and treatment plans developed by the team.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The post holder will also review and support the mental health elements while also being proactive in our outpatient psychiatry and Specialist Nurse/ Non-Medical practitioner /Pharmacist led clinics.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In partnership with Northumberland Health Care Trust (NHCT), who host the Care Program Approach (CPA) for this client group, the post holder will demonstrate a robust understanding of this methodology of care delivery assisting all parts of the MDT with this approach and risk management component.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Identified as a CPA contact within the CNTW service the post holder will attend and support CPA reviews and planning meetings as identified by the leadership team and MDT. The shared care and risk management recording protocols relating to complex mental health will be a major facet of the RNLD/RMN role within the wider team. Sound IT and system recording skills will be a fundamental prerequisite of the role.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For those with less direct experience of working with people with Learning Disabilities, awareness training and support will be available as required from the MDT expertise within the team. The community practitioner will be required to support or deliver elements of psycho social interventions (PSI) within the pathway. The associated use of Cognitive Behavioural Approaches (CBT) or other models alongside the team\u2019s psychology expertise would be an expected approach moving forward. Therefore experience or skills of PSI or one of more psychological models would be desirable such as CAT/DBT systemic models would be advantageous. Experience and awareness of wider mental health services or pathways such as eating disorders, neuro- disability, personality disorder, early intervention and autism would also be welcomed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Non-medical prescribing roles within the team are to be expanded in the short term. A second nurse prescriber role is planned to supplement the pharmacy prescriber and the specialist nurse who is in training at this time. NMP status would be a major advantage for the role as would the ability to demonstrate academic ability for this training in the immediate future.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The post currently sits within the enhanced part of the learning disability pathway provided by CNTW. Close partnership working and liaison with Community Learning Disability Nurses and other partners connected to the pathway will be another key component of the role.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The enhanced part of the pathway is a county wide service based at Greenacres, Ashington and delivers a range of specialist assessments and interventions. The team has expanded over recent years and currently comprises of a range of clinicians including Positive Behaviour Support Practitioners, clinical psychologists, clinical support worker and psychiatrist, and clinical pharmacist.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You must be a qualified RNLD or RMN with clinical experience or insight and awareness of people with a learning disability needs found across a range of community settings. Ideally you will have additional training or an interest in training to develop further competencies in PSI / psychological approaches. Good communication and organisational skills are essential as is confidence and the ability to remain calm and resilient in challenging community situations. Some occasional pre planned out of hours and weekend work may be required so you will need to be a flexible and responsive practitioner within the immediate team and be comfortable working across organisational boundaries. In turn you will join a dynamic and forward looking team where you will be offered excellent support and training and supervision opportunities to develop your skills further.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You must have a strong commitment to the delivery of high quality, safe, patient care and be a good role model in reflecting the Trusts core Values.

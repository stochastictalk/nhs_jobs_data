You may also be working with elective orthopaedic patients where we aim to provide high level care whilst achieving the best length of stay for the patient. Some will be suffering cognitive characteristics and many will be unable to move or care for themselves. You will also be working with our fractured neck of femur patients, where Queen Alexandra Hospital ranks in the top quartile nationally for best practice.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We work in a variety of settings and we endeavour to provide dynamic rehabilitation to aid the recovery of our patients.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You need to be well motivated and able to take initiative. The post holder must have excellent communication skills and be able to work as part of a team within the busy ward environment and enjoy the challenges of dealing with these clients. The post holder also needs to be organised and able to prioritise and manage their time effectively, as they will have to manage their own caseload of patients, as well as supporting the physiotherapists and undertaking some administrative tasks.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is an exciting time for Physiotherapy within Queen Alexandra Hospital, as we are one of the key services for these people to improve and leave hospital.

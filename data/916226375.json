We offer a thorough induction, supported by a robust supervision structure with joint working across the team, and a timetable that incorporates a range of development opportunities. This post is suitable for a newly-qualified practitioner, and specific guidance will be provided to support the achievement of RCSLT competencies.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You will be based locally within the South West Hampshire Locality, working across clinics, preschools and/or mainstream schools as required, with the opportunity to gain experience via supported rotations into more specialist settings; visits to families\u2019 homes may occasionally be required where clinically appropriate. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Therapists are primarily based in one of three areas (North: Winchester &amp; Andover; Central: Romsey, Eastleigh &amp; Southern Parishes; or South: New Forest). Location can be flexible, and is discussed and agreed according to the needs of both staff members and the caseload.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You will hold a specific, relevant degree-level qualification, have experience of working with children and show a proactive, enthusiastic approach to learning within this role.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You will be flexible, friendly and willing to work closely with others, both within therapies and as part of a multidisciplinary team to meet the needs of the clinical service. You will be keen to manage a basic caseload independently, identifying and seeking support as required.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You will have excellent foundation skills including a basic working knowledge of everyday clinical assessments and therapeutic interventions, and be confident to use a range of familiar assessment tools; you will be able to communicate with others in a warm and accessible way. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A Speech &amp; Language Therapy degree, RCSLT and HCPC membership are essential requirements for this position.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you would like further information or to informally discuss this role, please contact:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Rhiann Owen, &lt;span&gt;Speech and Language Therapy Clinical Co-ordinator, &lt;span&gt;07795 811 290&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Rhiann.Owen@solent.nhs.uk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/126954.jpg", "name": "Solent NHS Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=126954"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "South West Hampshire", "postalCode": "SO16 4XE"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "50.9252", "longitude": "-1.44603"}}, "title": "Speech and Language Therapist", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916226375", "validThrough": "2020-11-24T23:59:59+0000"}

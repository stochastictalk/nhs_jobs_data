Now, as we play our part in the investigation into how effective convalescent plasma is for treating coronavirus patients, it\u2019s never been more crucial.

With Donor Centres and Mobile Units across the UK we collect over 7,000 donations every day, to provide vital blood and blood products. Ours is a fast-moving, friendly environment, where our teams come together from different backgrounds and communities to help save and improve the lives of thousands of people every year.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the role &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As one of our Sister/Charge Nurses, you\u2019ll be caring for people who want to be here \u2013 donors doing their bit to help others.

Whether your skills are currently more clinical or leadership-focused, we\u2019ll support you to grow them both. You\u2019ll use clinical judgement to make decisions about donor suitability and ensure that patients receive safe blood and blood products. And you\u2019ll use your management skills to ensure our donors feel safe and cared for, and want to return time and time again.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The shift pattern for this role is 8 days per fortnight working 75 hours over these days, mainly involves working late shifts and not many early shifts.

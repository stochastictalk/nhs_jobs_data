Critically sick or injured children are transferred by the NWTS specialist team from a referring district general hospital into one of the two regional centres for paediatric intensive care (Alder Hey Children\u2019s Hospital or Royal Manchester Children\u2019s Hospital).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The service also provides clinical advice and support to district general hospital teams involved in the resuscitation and stabilisation of the sick or severely injured child.

It is expected that the clinical fellow will take an interest in an audit, guideline or quality assurance projects. In addition, the clinical fellow is part of the NWTS education team and is expected to be involved with the design and delivery of a wide variety of education and training projects run by NWTS.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Relevance to specialties &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Paediatric Intensive Care Medicine Grid trainees in UK &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Paediatrics &amp; sub-specialties (especially HDU, Neonatology, Respiratory, Cardiology) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Anaesthetics \u2013 both paediatric anaesthetists and local hospital anaesthetists&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Adult Intensive Care Medicine trainees&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=121137"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "NWTS, Newton House, Warrginton", "postalCode": "WA3 6FW"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "53.4281", "longitude": "-2.52289"}}, "title": "NWTS Senior Fellow in Paediatric Critical Care Transport Medicine", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916260499", "validThrough": "2020-11-27T23:59:59+0000"}

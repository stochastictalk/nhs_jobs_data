As an Outreach and Engagement Worker, you&#39;ll make a real difference to individual&#39;s lives as you provide support and advice to help each and every one of our service users achieve their potential. Passionate about people, you&#39;ll enjoy the scope and support to enhance your own life too, as you make this role your own as part of a hard-working and friendly team.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As an Outreach and Engagement Worker you will be 100% committed to ensuring our services are accessible to those who need them most and working with the local community to ensure our service meets their needs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Running services on a not-for-profit basis, we invest every penny back into our care - and our people. So, if you&#39;re ambitious and focused on helping people with substance misuse issues, progress an Outreach and Engagement Worker role with real value.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Role Responsibility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You will manage a small caseload of service users who are complex and hard to engage so you will need exceptional communication skills and the ability to persevere and work with resistance. You will carry out assessments on new service users outside of our fixed locations and a large amount of the role will be based in other community venues such as hospitals, GP surgeries, probation offices etc. We are passionate about taking our service to those who need it most so the Outreach and Engagement role is crucial to making this happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At a practical level, you&#39;ll need good IT and communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Ideal Candidate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You&#39;ll need a good working knowledge of issues related to substance misuse, as well as a genuine passion for the field. Although previous relevant experience, on either a voluntary basis or as a paid employee is preferable, most important is that you&#39;re flexible, patient and able to view situations from service users perspectives. As you&#39;d expect, good moral values will be key. Situations can sometimes be difficult and challenging, so you&#39;ll need to be non-judgemental, with a sensitive approach and a good understanding of how to meet needs related to substance misuse.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About us&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why Turning Point?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a leading health and social care provider with more than 300 locations across England, we take real pride in the services we offer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Across the varied regions, sectors and settings we operate within, our organisation is held together by a shared vision \u2013 and our people are connected by the same values. These include belief in potential, confidence in communication, embracing positive change and always treating each other as individuals.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We run all of our services on a not-for-profit basis; instead, we invest every penny back into our services and people. We never stop believing in change for the better, and we work constantly to improve the lives of the people we support.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our people bring our vision to life. So, if you are enthusiastic, motivated and committed to support others to fulfilling their potential, here at Turning Point, we don&#39;t just offer you a job \u2013 we offer you a career.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Benefits Will I Receive?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Of course, we know it&#39;s not about the money.

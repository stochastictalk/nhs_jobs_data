Travel time is paid, as is mileage.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Benefits includes 30 days holiday plus bank holidays, pro rata if part time, together with a 14% non-contributory pension.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Shortlisted candidates will be contacted to attend an interview and if sucessful will then be asked to attend one of our clinics.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Us&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are a CQC accredited healthcare provider of community based healthcare services including diagnostics, outpatient and ancillary services to NHS and private patients, currently within Bristol, North Somerset, South Gloucestershire and Gloucestershire but looking to branch out further to new CCG areas across England. In addition we offer a variety of support services to our shareholder base of 100 practices which comprise over 650 GPs who look after approximately 1,000,000 patients. Our services are clinically led, developed to meet patient needs and provide cost and efficiency savings to the NHS.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;GP Care&#39;s key patient values are:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Services are always designed around the patient&lt;/strong&gt; - services that are well managed, efficient, convenient and accessible for patients are generally cost effective for commissioners;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We treat patients with kindness, dignity and respect &lt;/strong&gt;- as if we were talking to a friend or relative about an important matter;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We always talk to patients&lt;/strong&gt; - we don&#39;t make appointments without direct verbal contact and patients are provided with a telephone contact number for each service, all of which are answered personally and promptly. We don&#39;t like automated voice systems and we don&#39;t use them;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keeping referring GPs informed&lt;/strong&gt; - all of our services provide GPs with discharge reports within 24 hours of an appointment as we believe this is critical to ensuring they are fully informed should a patient refer to them for continuing advice or support.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;GP Care is committed to a policy of equality in all our employment practices and it is essential that all staff are willing to make a positive contribution to the promotion and implementation of this.

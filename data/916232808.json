Here are some of the reasons you should attend our upcoming digital Nursing and ODP engagement day...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You\u2019ll hear an online presentation from our Anaesthesia, Surgery, Critical Care and Renal division on the opportunities available with our Theatre and Mediroom teams&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A new concept in healthcare, our Medirooms combine the traditional recovery, day-case, same-day and admission areas into a single patient room environment, specifically designed to enhance patient experience by improving the level of privacy and dignity that these areas were traditionally able to cover. Patients also benefit from continuity of care as they are admitted, recovered and discharged/transferred by the same Mediroom team.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Our anaesthetics and scrub practitioners also have access to unique multidisciplinary training delivered by our Perioperative simulation team within a purpose built simulation facility; our Clinical Simulation space.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You\u2019ll gain an insight into life at our Trust, including our award-winning health and wellbeing support, our commitment to equality, diversity and inclusion and our aspirations to be leaders in the field of sustainable healthcare.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You\u2019ll have the opportunity to book an interview for the day or an informal video call with our divisional clinical lead.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At our online event, you\u2019ll learn our Trust is pioneering, progressive and proud.

Out of the 90 questions asked, we had made 73 improvements from the previous year and 69% of staff would recommend our organisation as a place to work (6% better than the national average).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Our staff do not shy away from a challenge in aid of Southmead Hospital Charity. They cycle, run, row and race in aid of a fantastic cause, or sing in our staff choir and compete in \u2018Southmead Does Strictly\u2019.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We\u2019re committed to supporting staff on their career journey with us offering personalised training packages and bespoke specialty rotations. We also support internal transfers for those who wish to gain experience in a new specialty or further develop their skills.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Our staff are consulted on equity issues across the trust within equality and development groups, and are given the mentoring and support to succeed. Our trust supports the development of Bristol\u2019s LGBT+ manifesto and a case study of good practice has been reported to NHS England in response to a government review of public services and Trans people.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Our clinical environment is award-winning in its approach to healthcare design; each patient room has a view, many of which are naturally ventilated and 75% of rooms in our Brunel Building are single and en-suite. With nurses in mind, our clinical spine carefully separates staff and patient areas, with a generous staff canteen extending out to a rooftop terrace.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bristol is consistently voted the best place to live in the UK, with vibrant local music, arts and gastronomic scenes. Our city boasts a wide range of state-of-the-art shopping, recreation and leisure facilities, a wealth of great local family days out, and excellent transport links.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right, that\u2019s enough about us\u2026 let\u2019s focus on you.

We are passionate about our ethos and philosophy and are driven to provide the best care for our acutely unwell patients. We are moving into our new Acute Hospital \u201cThe Midland Metropolitan University Hospital\u201d in 2022 and Acute Medicine holds the largest footprint- including 14 Level 1 beds, 54 AMU beds, a 32 bedded Short Stay unit and a large independent Medical Ambulatory Area. The new state of the art acute hospital in Grove Lane, Smethwick will bring together all acute services onto one site.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Please note, there is also an opportunity to apply for the Clinical Director post within Emergency Care. Please note there will be a separate interview for this role which can take place on the same day of the AAC but not part of the AAC.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Acute Medicine within the Trust has developed from scratch over a matter of years and now is the most fundamental critical specialty for the workings of the trust. Acute physicians are highly influential and involved heavily in management and strategy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On average 60-65% of acute medical admissions are discharged within 24 hours, This has been credited to innovative services such as virtual clinics, daily walk in review, the ambulatory unit as well as our close relations with physiotherapy, OT, frail elderly and social teams. Despite our efficiencies we have many opportunities for quality and service improvement and seek candidate who can innovate, lead and contribute to this work.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Acute Medicine department is renowned for being the most popular site for Acute medical trainees. We have the first dedicated AMU Clinical Skills Lab within the UK which houses a simulator, CVP, LP and Chest drain training equipment and a won National Award was in May 2017 for innovation. Trainees receive training in USS, Echo, leadership, and are involved heavily in teaching and education. Courses run by the unit are IMPACT, \u201cUSS at the Front Door\u201d, Golden Hour and the AMAN training day. Feedback from the Foundation trainees is the one of the best training within the Trust. This has been credited to the teamwork \u201cfamily\u201d ethos that has been created and sustained. The department has been recognised with local, national and international awards/recognition of work, services and innovation including the more recent AMU placement block rota by the RCP 2018.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The successful candidates will be within 6 months of CCT in Acute Internal Medicine. We would be keen to offer development for new Consultants especially within the fields of leadership, management, education as well as research. A specialty session outside acute medicine is guaranteed. There is opportunity for research within acute medicine and keen to raise the profile and we are recruiting a research fellow to look into POCUS and Ambulatory Care. We are also very keen to accommodate flexible working. All new consultants join the Trusts well established New Consultants Leadership Program.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The single-site Acute Hospital will benefit from co-located specialist services which will support the new Emergency Department with dedicated imaging facility and Assessment Units. It will provide state-of-the-art treatment and care for patients from Sandwell and across the region and will become the civic heart of the area and a point of pride for the community.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Trust is a key partner with the local commissioning group and the local authorities in the Right Care Right Here program, which seeks to deliver a redevelopment of local health services. The program includes one of the largest investments in the UK with new facilities in both the acute and community sectors. Included within this is the new Midland Metropolitan Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Trust has a very good reputation for undergraduate and postgraduate teaching with strong links to the University of Birmingham and Health Education West Midlands. The Trust is home to a number of University departments and we are now looking to develop research capacity in a number of specialties in the Trust including Acute Medicine so there is likely to be opportunities to become involved in research activities.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Birmingham is a vibrant, multi-cultural city and it is a very exciting place to live and work.

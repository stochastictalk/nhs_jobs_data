They believe in magic. There is Polar Bear milk in their syringe pumps and fairy dust in their facemasks! They hope, they believe and they make wishes. You can be a part of their magic too!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As the Anaesthetic Practitioner at GOSH, you will have the privilege of caring for these children during their time in Theatres. You will be working in a team of over Anaesthetic Practitioners and an additional 220 multi-disciplinary staff across Theatres and the Directorate.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;GOSH covers most of the major surgical specialities, except for a liver service. Once you have settled in and completed your induction and orientation, you will have the absolute honour and unique opportunity to look after conjoined twins during their diagnostic stage and then undergoing complex separation surgery. We also assist with the very rare EXIT (Ex-Utero Intrapartum Treatment) Procedure over at University College Hospital. This is a highly specialized surgical delivery procedure used to deliver babies who have airway compression detected during antenatal scanning and therefore need airway support immediately upon birth. Futhermore, as the Anaesthetic Practitioner at GOSH, you will be at the forefront of new anaesthetic and surgical procedures as part of pioneering trials and research.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As there is no Accident &amp; Emergency Department here at Great Ormond Street, we accept specialist referrals from all over the globe. We predominantly take care of children with multiple disabilities and health problems as well as congenital birth conditions. Each child and their family require expert attention from a variety of different specialist teams.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;No paediatric experience? No problem! We offer a very comprehensive and informative induction programme and we house the most dedicated team of Practice Educators in each clinical environment within the hospital. GOSH is very committed to ensuring that all staff have the prospect of continuing their professional development. There are multiple opportunities to build on teaching and leadership and support given when applying for jobs within the Trust.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The rest of our magic happens in one of our 19 Theatres, with specialities including General, ENT, Orthopaedics, Spines, Plastics, Neurology, Craniofacial, Ophthalmology, Renal, Urology, Dental and Cardiology. We also extend our skilled services to Interventional Radiology, MRI, CT, Nuclear Medicine, Gastroenterology and Haematology/Oncology as well as Gamma Knife surgery, which takes place at our neighbour hospital The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now for a bit about our incredible Hospital and the revolutionary work it does - We at Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust (GOSH) are a National Centre of Excellence, specialising exclusively in children&#39;s health treatment. We currently deliver the widest range of expert care of any children&#39;s hospital in the UK. Within our walls we house the only pioneering Biomedical Research Centre for Paediatrics and the largest centre in the UK for children with cardiac or neurological problems. We also boast the biggest Paediatric Cancer centre in Europe and in partnership with the UCL Institute of Child Health (ICH); they form the UK\u2019s leading Paediatric Research and Teaching Centre in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The hospital receives over 255,000 patient visits (inpatient admissions or outpatient appointments) a year, and carries our approximately 18,800 operations each year and rising with the on-going development of new wards and operating theatre suites.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The hospital has 383 patient beds, including 44 intensive care beds (21 CICU, 15 PICU and 8 NICU). Many of the children and young people on our wards require high dependency care or are classed as ward intensive care, requiring one-to-one nursing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Around 4,100 full-time and part-time staff work at the hospital. The ICH has around 600 staff. Many senior staff have roles in both organisations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The hospital has approximately 50 paediatric specialties, the widest range of any hospital in the UK, which uniquely enables it to diagnose and pioneer treatments for children with highly complex, rare or multiple conditions. It has 19 highly specialised national services.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For further details / informal visits contact:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Rose Williams, Anaesthetic Team Leader via email at rose.williams@gosh.nhs.uk or via telephone on 0207 405 9200 Ext 7836.&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/121180.png", "name": "Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Foundation Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=121180"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Great Ormond Street Hospital, London", "postalCode": "WC1N 3JH"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "51.5222", "longitude": "-.119898"}}, "title": "Staff Nurse / ODP", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916254461", "validThrough": "2020-11-17T23:59:59+0000"}

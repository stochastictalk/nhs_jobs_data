Are you interested in improving health services in Liverpool?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In October 2019 Aintree University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and The Royal and Broadgreen University Hospitals NHS Trust merged to create Liverpool University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, one of the largest teaching hospital integrations in the North. The merger, which is clinically led, represents an exciting proposition for the Trust to consolidate current strengths and reconfigure services to play a fuller role in creating healthier, happier, fairer lives in partnership with the wider health system.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Trust\u2019s Integration Programme is seeking to support the transformation of health outcomes for patients by working with teams to develop single, city wide service models, for the delivery of healthcare services. The aim of the Programme is to address the current levels of variation and fragmentation of services across the Health Economy. This will be achieved through an ambitious clinical and corporate reconfiguration agenda which is already underway, led by the Integration programme management team.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An exciting opportunity has arisen to work in Liverpool University Hospitals NHS Trust\u2019s Integration Programme Management Office (PMO). We are currently seeking to recruit an innovative and creative professional and have a vacancy for a Head of Programme Management within the team. The post holder will lead the Integration / New Hospital operational preparedness programme collaboratively to ensure alignment of the integration and reconfiguration programme with planning for the opening of the new hospital.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a senior transformational role, working with a high degree of autonomy, at-pace, and at-scale, and requires a creative mind-set, excellent programme management and leadership skills. The role will require an experienced individual who can work in a fast paced, changing environment, someone who is quick to adapt to new situations and can demonstrate resilience. The role requires someone who is experienced in working in a programme and project management environment leading and delivering complex, large scale change across multiple areas.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The post holder will be responsible for working in a Programme Management system, based upon best practice in programme management delivery, including a governance and assurance framework that links with the governance and assurance structure of the new organisation. The post holder will act autonomously; high level scrutiny and analysis of plans will be required.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The post holder must have a formal project and/or programme management qualification or relevant expert experience of working in a portfolio, programme and project management environment, along with experience of managing a series of complex inter related projects / programmes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a fixed term post for 18 months. The successful candidate will be based at either Aintree University Hospital or the Royal Liverpool University Hospital but will be expected to travel across and work from both sites and other sites when required.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;For further details / informal visits contact:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Helen Murphy, Assistant Director of Integration&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Email helen.murphy@liverpoolft.nhs.uk&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Telephone number0151 706 2985&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/121281.png", "name": "Liverpool University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=121281"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "LUFHT and across the Health Economy in Liverpool, Liverpool", "postalCode": "L7 8XP"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "53.4095", "longitude": "-2.96481"}}, "title": "Head of Integration Programme Management", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916256598", "validThrough": "2020-11-11T23:59:59+0000"}

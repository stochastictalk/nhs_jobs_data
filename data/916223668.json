This is a new post in addition to the 4 current substantive Colorectal Surgery consultants and will provide emergency on-call commitments on a 1:10 basis and regular endoscopy lists. The post has been developed in response to an increasing demand in pelvic floor, proctology, inflammatory bowel disease and joint endometriosis services. This post is not intended to provide regular cancer resectional surgery. The post-holder is expected to work closely within multidisciplinary teams including healthcare professionals spanning the Urogynaecology, Gynaecology and Gastroenterology departments. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Applicants require both general and colorectal elective and emergency surgical competencies, as well as JAG certification in colonoscopy. A post-CCT fellowship and/or consultant-level experience in endometriosis, pelvic floor and inflammatory surgery is desirable. &lt;/strong&gt;The successful applicant should have an audit and research portfolio, with an ongoing interest in expanding the portfolio and experience in establishing research trials. They should also demonstrate management responsibilities and a significant commitment to teaching and training of junior staff.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Applicants should either already be on the Specialist Register of the General Medical Council (GMC), or within six months of eligibility to be included, and hold a license to practice.

We have an exciting opportunity for a full-time Band 8B Principal Clinical Psychologist to lead locally on the development of a new Stepped Care Therapies Service for older people. The post allows for varied clinical work complimented by managerial endeavour allowing the post holder to lead locally but also feed into Directorate wide initiatives and contribute to the ongoing development of Psychology provision for Older People\u2019s mental health.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Clinically there is the opportunity to work with: anxiety of all different aetiologies, depression, psychosis, eating disorders, trauma survivors, emotional dysregulation, amongst other functional conditions as well as numerous and varied organic issues such as young onset dementia. The variety of clinical aetiology is then complimented by the manner in which we work; individually, with family and other caring \u2018systems\u2019, couples work, consultation with our MDT colleagues and we are looking to develop therapeutic groups to meet patient needs. The service has also recently expanded our repertoire of delivery to include remote appointments. The service has a good history of providing further CPD opportunities for dedicated clinicians looking to develop their skill sets through formal training and supporting individual clinician projects (for example, the delivery of Trust wide Equality and Diversity sessions to raise awareness of Transgender issues).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust have developed and embedded an integrated model of community physical and mental health care at primary and secondary care levels. This is an excellent opportunity to further support the development of this service including memory assessment service and advising the wider team and in-reach to inpatient services when appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This post will be part of a stepped care therapy service comprising of Clinical Psychologists, Psychological therapists, Occupational therapists and Mental health practitioners.

There are opportunities for undertaking clinical interventions, delivering training, providing supervision to the wider team and developing combined interventions/approaches for people with long term conditions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The qualified Clinical Psychologist (registered with the Health and Care Professions Council) will have experience of working in a variety of mental health settings.

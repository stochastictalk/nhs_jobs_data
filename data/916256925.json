New investment under the NHS Long Term Plan requires rapid implementation and evaluation of this innovative service development. The service sits under Perinatal Mental Health alongside the inpatient Mother and Baby Unit and expanding Community Mental Health Services, and will be embedded within the Maternity setting, covering Birmingham Women\u2019s Hospital and University Hospitals Birmingham (Heartlands, Good Hope and Netherbrook Birth Unit Solihull). The remit is to establish effective care pathways for perinatal loss (particularly stillbirth and neonatal death) and for birth trauma and fear of childbirth (tokophobia). This includes identification of mental health problems in Maternity, provision of support and signposting and delivery of targeted evidence-based psychological interventions. Working with Maternity systems including provision of support and supervision for Maternity staff is integral to the model. The service will be coproduced with principles of diversity and inclusion embedded throughout.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As Consultant Clinical Psychologist and Service Lead, the post-holder will lead the planning, implementation, delivery and evaluation of the service. The main clinical work undertaken by the post-holder is to provide highly specialist psychological assessment and intervention for perinatal loss and trauma. The role involves management and supervision of a team of staff, including qualified and unqualified psychologists. Being allied to the wider Perinatal Service, the post holder will be part of the Perinatal Psychology Leadership Team and will receive specialist supervision from a Consultant Perinatal Clinical Psychologist. Experience of working within Perinatal Mental Health is essential as is ability to deliver evidence-based psychological interventions for trauma and loss. Service development and leadership experience is highly desirable.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You will join a friendly, inclusive and supportive Psychology Service that offers excellent opportunities for personal development, special interests and research, that is committed to providing training and supervision opportunities for its staff and that supports networking, exchange of good practice and peer support amongst Psychologists and members of other disciplines across the Trust.

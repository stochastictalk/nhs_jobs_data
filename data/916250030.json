The Training Programme Director will focus upon improvement of learner supervision, assessment and experience, engagement of faculty and ensuring effective educational outcomes, both now and in the future. The role is evolving and will also focus on whole workforce transformation and developing multi- professional links.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;To support the Postgraduate Dean, Training Programme Directors will work across the spectrum of health and where relevant, social care, within the context of a team, so that the provision of education reflects changing service models.

We have grown to become a medium sized enterprise providing a range of community-based services to the NHS, alongside Occupational Health services to the corporate sector. We are continually evolving our proposition to patient care, and we\u2019re building a highly skilled multi-disciplinary team where our clinical service provides care and expertise in chronic pain, rheumatology, and mental health alongside musculoskeletal therapy. Our talented clinical team make us who we are and are why we are proud of how we improve the lives of the patients.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The post requires the management and leadership of a community MSK and Pain service for the patients of North Kirklees and MSK CATS service in Wakefield.\u00a0 It has been commissioned by the local CCGs to provide the highest standards of clinical care to patients utilising the service.\u00a0 You will also have a responsibility to ensure the highest standards are met by our key stakeholders e.g. GP\u2019s, patient groups, commissioners, secondary care providers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You\u2019ll be a people manager with a track record of delivering results in a field-based role, particularly in a healthcare/NHS related role.\u00a0 You\u2019ll be an excellent communicator and an assertive decision maker who is passionate about delivering and maintaining high standards of clinical care and service delivery.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We\u2019re looking for you to have demonstrable experience of the ability to attract, develop and retain an engaged team.\u00a0 This team will consist of administrative and clinical components and their well-being and performance will be your responsibility to not only maintain but to enhance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You\u2019ll have a strong commercial focus and commitment to delivering on KPIs and financial performance targets whilst maintaining the highest standards of clinical care within the service. This is a pro-active position, and you\u2019ll need to achieve against a backdrop of a changing work environment and commercial pressures.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;We would consider splitting the Service Manager role for the two services if combined with maintaining a clinical caseload within the service. For example, this could be a Service Manager across North Kirklees and Wakefield, or a Clinical Service Manager for North Kirklees &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;and a&lt;/span&gt; Clinical Service Manager for Wakefield. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Ideally you will have experience of leading and managing a team of clinical colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Connect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Connect Health was founded in 1993 by Professor Andrew Walton, who remains as the Group Executive Director.

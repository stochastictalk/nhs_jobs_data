We serve just under 1.5 million people across our six diverse boroughs: Croydon, Kingston, Merton, Richmond, Sutton and Wandsworth.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It is our job to make sure that the people of South West London benefit from convenient and high quality healthcare services whenever they are needed \u2013 whether this is advice from a pharmacist or GP, a procedure in hospital, help at home through local community services, or if you need support with your mental health.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a member of the SWL CCG Performance team, this post will support the design and implementation of the performance management framework that will assist in the delivery of national and local targets.

Here are some of the reasons we\u2019re unique\u2026 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The Intensive Care Unit is a purpose built state of the art 48-bedded unit within one of the UK\u2019s first \u00a3450 million super-hospitals, achieving excellent outcomes including some of the highest trauma survival rates in the country.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Our unit features two high-fidelity simulation suites, allowing for immediate skills training led by a multi-disciplinary team of clinical education experts.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We offer those joining us a new challenge in a forward thinking environment. This is supported by a robust orientation and structured development pathway that can be tailored to both experienced nurses and those new to ICU.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;As well as being one of the busiest Major Trauma centres in the UK, we are also a regional centre for neurosurgery, vascular surgery, urology, spinal surgery, renal as well as burns and plastics.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But it\u2019s not just our intensive care unit which is impressive; our trust itself is pioneering, progressive and proud. Let us tell you a little more about it\u2026&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Our health and wellbeing initiat\u00ad\u00ad\u00adives, devised by our dedicated staff wellbeing team, encompass lifestyle support, physical support and psychological support, and have been nationally recognised by REBA.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We value staff feedback; in the results of our 2019 staff survey, our response rate was &lt;strong&gt;higher than the national average &lt;/strong&gt;and highlighted we had improved in all the areas staff told us were priorities in 2018. Out of the 90 questions asked, we had made 73 improvements from the previous year and 69% of staff would recommend our organisation as a place to work (6% better than the national average).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Our nurses do not shy away from a challenge in aid of Southmead Hospital Charity. They cycle, run, row and race in aid of a fantastic cause, or sing in our staff choir and compete in \u2018Southmead Does Strictly\u2019.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We\u2019re committed to supporting staff on their career journey with us offering personalised training packages and bespoke specialty rotations. We also support internal transfers for those who wish to gain experience in a new specialty or further develop their skills.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Our staff are consulted on equity issues across the trust within equality and development groups, and are given the mentoring and support to succeed. Our trust supports the development of Bristol\u2019s LGBT+ manifesto and a case study of good practice has been reported to NHS England in response to a government review of public services and Trans people.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Our clinical environment is award-winning in its approach to healthcare design; each patient room has a view, many of which are naturally ventilated and 75% of rooms in our Brunel Building are single and en-suite. With nurses in mind, our clinical spine carefully separates staff and patient areas, with a generous staff canteen extending out to a rooftop terrace.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bristol is consistently voted the best place to live in the UK, with vibrant local music, arts and gastronomic scenes. Our city boasts a wide range of state-of-the-art shopping, recreation and leisure facilities, a wealth of great local family days out, and excellent transport links. If you prefer country, village or smaller town living, our trust is easily commutable from a range of attractive locations in North Somerset, South Gloucestershire and South Wales.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right, that\u2019s enough about us\u2026 let\u2019s focus on you.

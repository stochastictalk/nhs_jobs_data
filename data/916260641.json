You may also be required to assist with moving and handling of individuals. You must be a car driver and have the use of a car for work. Good IT skills and computer literacy are also essential.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You will be based with the team in the South of the borough and you will be supported to do any relevant training you require.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For further information, please contact:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Jill Wilkinson, Clinical Lead OT, Therapies and Dietetics on 07725 487892.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;or email: jill.wilkinson2@nhs.net or jill.wilkinson@rotherham.gov.uk&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/121484.png", "name": "The Rotherham NHS Foundation Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=121484"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Rotherham", "postalCode": "S60 2UD"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "53.4144", "longitude": "-1.34257"}}, "title": "Assistant Practitioner", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916260641", "validThrough": "2020-11-15T23:59:59+0000"}

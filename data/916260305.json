Every year, LTHT provides healthcare and specialist services for people from the city of Leeds, Yorkshire and the Humber and beyond. We also play an important role in the training and education of medical, nursing and dental students and are a centre of world-class research and pioneering new treatments.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Our vision is to be the best for specialist and integrated care. Our staff helped to define the values and behaviours that we should work to so that we can achieve this vision. This has become known as \u2018The Leeds Way\u2019, and forms the foundation of our culture, our ethos and how we work every day. These values are \u2013 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We are patient-centred; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We are fair; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We are collaborative; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We are accountable; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We are empowered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We are committed to delivering the highest quality and safest treatment and care to every patient, every time. This starts with being a good employer, which means that we look after our people and support them to achieve the best they can as professionals and provide the best care for our patients. This has been more important than ever during the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Leeds Improvement Method (LIM) underpins all of our improvement work at LTHT. The philosophy of LIM is that everyone working in our hospitals feels empowered to make improvements in their daily work bringing the benefits of a safe, high quality experience, for every patient and every member of staff.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We are working hard with our city partners to integrate our health care services, and ensure that our city and region get the recognition and investment we need to provide the people of Leeds and the wider region with the very best services.

This has allowed us to make record levels of investment in maintaining and improving our hospitals and infrastructure. We have achieved Level 3 accreditation of the Future Focused Finance staff development programme and we have been recognised by the HFMA, as \u2018Finance Team of the Year\u2019.\u00a0 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We are now seeking to appoint the key leadership role of Assistant Director of Finance - Capital.

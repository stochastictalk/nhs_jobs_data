Prisons/IRC\u2019s are among the most challenging, yet rewarding places for healthcare professionals to work. Working alongside nurses and other healthcare professionals, a bank contract gives the flexibility to fit in with other commitments but also gives you access to training and potential new career pathways.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The role of the Senior Paramedic in the Offender care is relatively new however it has been very well received from healthcare colleagues and prison staff alike. The unique skills of our paramedics to take charge of the scene with authority has provided staff and patients with a sense of assurance and confidence in the care being given.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As an offender care paramedic you will be required to work within the prison and on the Wings within the establishments as key member of the broader primary care team. You will be delivering a wide range of services including high quality emergency care, minor injury treatment, medication administration and healthcare promotion. Treating more than just symptoms looking past how the person has ended up in their situation and providing high quality holistic patient care.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Providing for the physical and mental health needs of offenders is paramount, being able to assess patients, plan their care, administer treatment and discharge them or refer them as appropriate to a wide range of healthcare professionals on site or to external agencies. The advantage of being involved so closely in the care is that you get to follow up on the decisions made, getting the feedback, unlike just handing over to an emergency department then moving on to the next job, so enabling you to gain the knowledge that you have made a difference to their life.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While we are looking to recruit bank staff for HM YOI Feltham by joining the CNWL Offender Care bank you would be able to work across multiple sites.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;CNWL run healthcare services at the following sites&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;HM YOI Feltham&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;IRC Heathrow&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;HMP Highdown&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;HMP Downview&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;HMP Coldingly&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;HMP Send&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;HMP Woodhill&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All appointments are subject to successful prison vetting processes&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For further details / informal visits contact:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;NameAnnemarie Carter \u2013 HM YOI FelthamAdditional contact information&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Annemarie Carter \u2013 HM YOI Feltham , ann-marie.carter2@nhs.net, 02088445234&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Stella Simpson \u2013 Regional Manager \u2013 Youth Custody stellasimpson@nhs.net, 07720809443&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "TEMPORARY", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=120736"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "HMP Feltham, Feltham", "postalCode": "TW13 4NP"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "51.4417", "longitude": "-.434392"}}, "title": "Senior Paramedic - Bank Staff (Covid-19 Response)", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916248834", "validThrough": "2020-11-12T23:59:59+0000"}

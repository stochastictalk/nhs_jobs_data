Each MHST works within a cluster of schools and offers a schools based mental health service, as well as supporting the implementation of a Whole School Approach (WSA) to mental health across the cluster. There are strong links between all the teams and a good peer support network across the Trust MHSTs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The FE College MHST comprises of a team lead and supervisor who is an experienced Clinical Psychologist, a newly qualified psychologist, 2 Primary Mental Health Workers and 4 Education Wellbeing Practitioners (EWPs), making a total of eight team members. The FE College cluster comprises of six Further Education Colleges across the six boroughs of South West London. The MHST will work collaboratively with colleges to implement a Whole College Approach to mental health, including staff consultation and training. Post holders will also provide individual, group and workshop interventions for young people within the colleges and there will be opportunities for working with parents / carers when appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The FE Colleges MHST has an additional specialist focus on transition points for young people. These include transition from school into the college system and also transition into adulthood (moving into higher education or employment, leaving home, moving into adult mental health services etc).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the role:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;These 2 posts are both Agenda for Change band 6 full time. While the roles are advertised as primary mental health workers to attract a wide variety of applicants, successful applicants will be able to use their qualified role titles once appointed if preferred.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As this position is based within colleges, all annual leave will need to be taken during college holidays. Job shares and flexible working hours will be considered as appropriate as long as successful job share applicants can cover the hours of a full time post between them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The post holders will offer direct clinical interventions to young people and parent / carers in both individual, group and workshop formats. This will include working directly with young people who are struggling with their mental health in a variety of ways. The post holders will collaboratively work with colleges to implement a whole college approach to mental health, including staff consultation and training as appropriate and as agreed with the MHST lead. The post holders will also take a lead on triaging cases, when necessary, for the EWPs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Regular supervision will be provided by the MHST lead or the band 7 within the team. We have a strong network across the 6 MHSTs within the Trust and across the wider SW London partnership to enable sharing resources, learning and providing support. Cross team training and peer support opportunities are encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Some travel between colleges and base is essential but this can be managed by public transport or cycling.

Would you like to be given the opportunity to develop the skills required to care for the increasing demands of patients who are cared for in the modern NHS. Would you like to feel supported by your team and senior managers?\u00a0 If you have answered yes then I am proud to say that Worcester City In-Patient Unit is the place for you. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Unit is part of Worcestershire Health and Care NHS Trust and holds the traditional values of a community hospital with high standards of holistic care, time to talk to your patient, build relationships and be part of their recovery from admission to discharge. Care for patients with a multitude of conditions, to rehabilitation, to end of life care. In addition to this we also look after patients with sub-acute needs and provide support through our training and development team for all staff to have the skills required to care for such complex patients. All RNs are supported to achieve the Trusts core competencies with training provided for RNs to cannulate, perform venepuncture, be IV competent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you are newly qualified the trust offers a preceptorship programme where you would be supported by a ward mentor and the preceptorship programme lead. If you have been qualified for over a year and would like to become a mentor, we can provide this training through Worcester University; this is something that is actively encouraged as we are passionate about developing our staff. We have high impact ambassadors/link nurses for a variety of roles from tissue viability to important choices (end of life care). If you have a particular area of interest you are actively encouraged to become a link nurse/ambassador and are provided with the training to perform the role.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We expect our nurses to hold the values of the trust be courageous, ambitious, responsive, empowering and supportive. If you hold these values and this letter appeals to you please spend some time to apply and come and work with us and be part of the exciting developments in our hospital. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;All staff whatever their role, level or responsibility will be encouraged and supported to do their job well and to improve their job.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Making Every Day Better for patients, staff, service users and carers is the responsibility of all of us and we want to embed a culture within the organisation that encourages and supports the drive to improve what we do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yours sincerely&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jo Roberts, Matron&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/120795.jpg", "name": "Worcestershire Health and Care NHS Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=120795"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Worcester", "postalCode": "WR5 2DD"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "52.1779", "longitude": "-2.21305"}}, "title": "Staff Nurse", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916248217", "validThrough": "2020-11-15T23:59:59+0000"}

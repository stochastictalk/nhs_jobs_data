Sarah recently gave a great deal of help to a young person, her partner and baby. The baby needed to be admitted to Hospital in Norwich for pre op tests. Unfortunately the young person had no funds to pay for transport to the hospital, and this would have resulted in the baby\u2019s procedure being cancelled. No one involved with the family was able to provide the money to pay for this, but Sarah spent all day trying to find a solution. She managed to find funding in the end resulting in a good outcome for the baby and the family&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thank you Sarah\u00a0&lt;/em&gt;from us all.\u201d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Feel the Difference&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We partner with the NHS to make a real difference to people in North Essex and we\u2019re building a working environment where colleagues too can really feel the difference.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It\u2019s the kind of place where nothing\u2019s too much trouble.

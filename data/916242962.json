The priority is staff to work in our busiest periods from 11:30am to 8pm. There may also be a need for late (4pm till midnight) or night shift staff on a rotational basis and with standard NHS unsocial Premium rate. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A flexible approach to working hours is required as the Department provides a 24/7/365 service.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The posts will spend the majority of the time based at JRH in Oxford, but will be required to spend some time on the Churchill site.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The successful candidate(s) will work as part of a busy multidisciplinary team and have a positive professional approach to patient care.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;No unsolicited recruitment agency telephone calls or emails.

The assessment was made against 20 key findings from the national staff survey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\u2022 ELHT was included in a shortlist of the 100 \u2018Best Places to Work\u2019 compiled by the Health Service Journal and Nursing Times. The Trust was also one of only 42 selected of Acute Trusts nationally recognised by the publications as leading the way as the best place to work. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\u2022 Building on the development of our first dementia friendly ward in 2014 (C5), the dedication of staff on this ward, resulted in them being awarded the prestigious Quality Mark in 2015 based on reviews submitted by patients. Run by the Royal College of Psychiatrists, the Quality Mark was established to encourage hospital wards to become involved in improving the quality of essential care of older people and to recognise good care provision, as identified by patient feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So you can see why you need to think seriously about what working at East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust could do for your career. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make the process as simple as possible we suggest that you start to apply for a post, up to 6 months prior to completing your course. Clicking on the link below takes you to our online application form. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Complete this and you will then be invited to interview at our regular recruitment events.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this stage we will be seeing that you are suitable to join the trust and hopefully make you a conditional offer of a job with us. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the interview we will gather any preferences that you may have as regards your first post but we are conscious that with 6 months left of your course these could still change. Therefore about 3 months before you qualify you will be asked to confirm your preferred area to work in. Once we have everyone\u2019s preferences we will then allocate accordingly. We work hard to make sure that you are happy with your first posting and are happy to consider rotational post also. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even after you have started with us there will be opportunities to rotate with the various areas and develop your skills. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The areas covered by this programme are listed below. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\u2022 Medicine for Older People &lt;br /&gt;\u2022 Endocrinology &lt;br /&gt;\u2022 Gastroenterology &lt;br /&gt;\u2022 Respiratory&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For further details / informal visits contact:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Yvonne Spencer - Yvonne.spencer@elht.nhs.uk&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=120742"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Royal Blackburn Teaching Hospital/Burnley General Teaching Hospital, Blackburn/Burnley", "postalCode": "BB10 2PQ"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "53.8098", "longitude": "-2.22817"}}, "title": "Staff Nurse - Medicine and Emergency Care For Students Due to Qualify", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916243261", "validThrough": "2020-11-16T23:59:59+0000"}

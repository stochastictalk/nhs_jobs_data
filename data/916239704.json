Free parking is available on site at all of our hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The sole focus of the teams, which include physios, occupational therapists and social care, is rehabilitation, so as a staff nurse you will play a key role in delivering high quality nursing and rehabilitation care, ensuring we are promoting our patients\u2019 independence at every opportunity, whether dressing, walking or eating, so they achieve as much independence as they can before they leave our care.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You will have the chance to work autonomously for much of the time, with responsibility for making clinical decisions and judgements as part of the multi-disciplinary team. Working on a community rehabilitation ward, you will have time to build relationships with patients and their families, involving them in planning safe and effective care and discharge plans.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The successful candidates will have access to a fantastic range of training, learning and development opportunities, both internally and externally. These include a wide range of clinical courses (from dementia training and palliative care to wound care and learning from incidents) as well as leadership and management skills programmes, IT skills courses and apprenticeships up to degree level.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Post holders will be required to work weekends and nights on a rota basis. Those requesting predominantly night work would be required to work a period of 3 weeks of day shifts every 6 months. Shift times are 8am-8pm. Free parking available on site.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to work for a different type of NHS employer where you will be part of a motivated, supportive multi-disciplinary team, and your passion is delivering high quality, kind and compassionate rehabilitation care, we want to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/123532.JPG", "name": "CSH Surrey", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=123532"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "New Epsom and Ewell Community Hospital, Epsom and Ewell, Surrey", "postalCode": "KT19 8PB"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "51.3417", "longitude": "-.301644"}}, "title": "Band 5 Staff Nurse", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916239704", "validThrough": "2020-11-06T23:59:59+0000"}

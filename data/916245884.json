Careful thought has been given to the whole pathway and there is a strong commitment to increasing access to psychology and psychological therapies both in frequency of contact and in the range of interventions available. In order to meet this need and take part in the exciting re-design of services, we are advertising one full-time band 8a Practitioner Psychologist Post, working across the Crisis team and Oaklands, our 16 bedded mixed inpatient ward for working age adults. The post holder will be expected to work as an integral part of the wider multidisciplinary team.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Your primary role is to provide complex assessments, formulations and evidence based therapeutic interventions for individuals, groups and families. Some experience of working within acute or crisis settings, or specialist services engaging individuals with psychosis or personality disorder would be of benefit. A solid understanding of recovery principles is essential. You will also support your colleagues and help to nurture a therapeutic culture by supporting other team members to deliver psychologically informed interventions though the provision of supervision and reflective practice and, to supervise Band 6 Psychological therapists. We are very excited about these developments and the positive impact it is likely to have on the local communities that serve our Acute Care Pathway.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As part of the wider adult mental health service you will also be joining a small community of psychological therapists who bring a rich variety of skills. We place a high value on staff wellbeing and you will receive regular clinical supervision and support from the Lead Psychologist for Acute Care.

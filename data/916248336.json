Sessions may run during daytimes, evenings and weekends.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You will undertake administrative duties in support of the Team&#39;s work, and so the successful applicants will need to be IT literate and willing to undertake some office-based duties when required.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You will help us to provide safer working environments by undertaking other practical tasks around Trust sites, and may support H&amp;S Advisors with a range of duties including inspections and visits to Trust workplaces.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We have 3 posts available.

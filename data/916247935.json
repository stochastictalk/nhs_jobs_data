Our model of care is our Wellbeing Approach \u2013 an integrated, comprehensive approach in recognition of the fact prisoners are a socially-excluded group with healthcare needs which are complex and often associated with poor outcomes. It adopts the premise no single health/wellbeing factor can be taken in isolation of other motivational issues which might impact a person\u2019s care.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We\u2019ll utilise the wellbeing model to put patient care and safety at the heart of everything we do through assessing prisoners across 5 domains of; physical and mental wellbeing, substance misuse, relationships and resettlement. The patient and clinician complete a wellbeing wheel assessment to set goals and outcomes in partnership. The patient will complete the assessment and any needs identified will be met by our fully integrated service delivery team.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;About the Job&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a Substance Misuse Nurse, you must be able to carry out comprehensive assessments, initiate and review individual recovery plans and confidently communicate the full range of treatment options available to service users.

I have worked here for 15 years and still love coming to work every day in this team, which wouldn\u2019t exist without the combined energy, expertise and effort of my colleagues, providing care to a small group of vulnerable service users with complex needs. Are you a registered Mental Health Nurse or Learning Disability Nurse looking for a new challenge to support me and our service users through their journey to recovery?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The way we care for people with Learning Difficulties in Suffolk is changing at NSFT as we have recently benefited from \u00a31.3 million of investment in our acute service. &lt;strong&gt;We are also investing in our staff and this post offers a welcome bonus of \u00a33000*.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Learning Disability and Autism Specialist Service is not only being invested in financially, with a fresh approach to ideas and service delivery being supported by the Trust, we are confident our new model of care is the very best for the people we care for.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We invest heavily in training, provide first class support, promote collaborative teamwork and give everyone in our team the opportunities and resources to achieve their full potential. The teams are updating their Positive Behaviour Support skills with the British Institute for Learning Disability (BILD) and enjoy other training such as Makaton as part of a wide selection of subjects delivered at our monthly protected days. All staff are involved in a variety of Quality Improvement projects.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are keen to benefit from your expertise and experience to help us develop a truly multi-disciplinary approach to patient care, in return for which we will enhance your nursing skills through career development programmes and a commitment to your continuing professional and career development.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The wards form part of the acute service for learning disability and autism, along with the Intensive Support Team (IST), who work with people in the community to prevent unnecessary hospital admissions or providing transitional support between services. The acute teams are part of a wider specialist service who all work closely together to create a seamless approach for the clients and their families. Staff can benefit from this close working relationship with the potential for rotational roles between teams.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We support flexible working within the team, to include opportunities for part-time, job-share and flexible working patterns.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Ipswich is the perfect commuter town with an excellent train service on the Norwich to London line.

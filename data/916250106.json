Serving around three million people across Staffordshire and North Wales, UHNM is one of the largest hospital trusts in the country. Its 10,000 strong workforce provides the full range of emergency treatment, planned operations and medical care from the two hospitals in Stafford (County Hospital) and Stoke-on-Trent (Royal Stoke University Hospital).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In March 2012, the Royal Stoke University Hospital became a Major Trauma Centre, serving Staffordshire, Shropshire and part of Cheshire. The Trust\u2019s catchment area has now expanded to serve a population of 2.25 million people with the additional three Trauma Units in North Wales providing a large, sustainable major trauma network.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \u00a3370m state-of-the-art hospital complex opened in March 2012 bringing all acute services (including Neurosurgery and Cardiothoracic Surgery) to a single site. The new Emergency Department offers modern facilities including state of the art diagnostics, an 8 bedded resus and CT scanner within 20 meters of the helipad and a co-located Children\u2019s Emergency Department and Assessment Unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;County Hospital has recently opened a brand new Children\u2019s Emergency Centre. The centre, which is specifically available for children, offers urgent medical care and advice from a team specialising in both Emergency Medicine and Paediatrics. The Adult Emergency Department is undergoing a redesign over the next 18 months to provide a fantastic, modern Emergency Department for the population of South Staffordshire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More than 160,000 patients attend our Emergency departments.

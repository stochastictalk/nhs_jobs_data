This is a fixed term position while we recruit substantively. This job is aimed at someone interested in applying for a substantive post at the Royal London Hospital. The successful candidate will join the well-established surgical and trauma liaison service called T-POPs (Trauma and Peri-operative service) and be part of further developing the role of specialist geriatric input to the surgical specialities. This is an exciting opportunity for a self-motivated individual to support the expansion of a service to provide multidisciplinary Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment to all of the surgical specialities , including elective and emergency admissions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The posts offer an exciting opportunity to join a dynamic and welcoming consultant team, to develop new models of care/services that support the people of Tower Hamlets and the wider region.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;These posts will be based at Royal London Hospital which is a Major Trauma Centre and with that there is a requirement to meet the new Best Practice Tariff for Elderly Major Trauma. In addition to being the major surgical centre in the region, there are growing numbers of older people undergoing increasingly complex surgery. There is therefore a significant clinical need for geriatrician support and ample opportunity to develop innovative ways of working alongside the surgeons, including potential for research. There is an established High Risk Anaesthetic service and with service expansion, the vision would be embed geriatricians and therapists from the T-POPS team into that existing service to provide CGA from the outset and throughout the patient journey.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For further details / informal visits contact:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You require full registration with the General Medical Council with the licence to practice.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For more information or to arrange a visit please contact Dr Sophie Edwards Clinical Lead sophie.edwards10@nhs.net or Dr Mark Blunden Clinical Director mblunden@nhs.net .&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/120603.jpg", "name": "Barts Health NHS Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=120603"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "The Royal London Hospital, London", "postalCode": "E1 1BB"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "51.519", "longitude": "-.058048"}}, "title": "Locum Consultant in Older People Services", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916222103", "validThrough": "2020-11-15T23:59:59+0000"}

It provides same day clinical assessment to acutely unwell patients that are unable to travel to their surgery Using the same clinical software, patients are referred directly into appointment slots by a GP from a local practice. Patients are then seen by an experienced Clinician equipped with OxFed laptops, which allow direct access to the patient\u2019s full electronic notes and real time notes recording.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, healthcare providers across Oxfordshire have responded and worked collaboratively to set up CALM clinics, visiting services and a monitoring service, together becoming the Community, Assessment, Liaison and Monitoring (CALM) Service.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are now looking to recruit additional members to the Home Visiting clinical team as experienced Advanced Nurses and/or Paramedic Practitioners to deliver a service as part of the CALM portfolio. This will bring added resilience to the service, additional skill sets and assist the continuing delivery and design of the service.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The post holder(s) will be expected to visit patients in their own homes and autonomously undertake, clinical assessments of acutely unwell patients on behalf of the referring GP. Once the patient has been seen, clinical diagnosis and a management plan can then either be formulated by the visiting clinician (depending on their clinical expertise) or after collaboration and discussion with the patient\u2019s own GP. Prescribing is not required as this will be actioned by the patient\u2019s own GP.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is provided for all staff working in CALM services and it is expected that the current guidance on its use is followed completely. All members of staff are encouraged to regularly review the latest guidelines to ensure their practice is current or if necessary update it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Once we have received sufficient appropriate applications, we may withdraw the advertisement.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No agencies please.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "TEMPORARY", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "OxFed Health & Care Ltd", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=134820"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Oxford", "postalCode": "OX3 9RF"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "51.7704", "longitude": "-1.22685"}}, "title": "Home Visiting Clinician \u2013 CALM Services", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916260528", "validThrough": "2020-12-11T23:59:59+0000"}

The section supports radioisotope services on two main sites (Churchill and John Radcliffe Hospitals) and Great Western Hospital. This includes oncology, nuclear medicine and PET/CT, nuclear cardiology, laboratories etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We currently support 5 SPECT gamma cameras (2 with CT), 2 PET / CT scanners and a new digital dedicated cardiac scanner. 3 gamma cameras are due for replacement in the next 12 months. The clinical services we support provides a wide range of radionuclide therapies and diagnostic imaging and non-imaging tests. In addition, the section is very involved in the provision of radiation protection support to all departments using radioisotopes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The section also provides support to a large number of clinical trials, including novel PET and SPECT tracers and new therapeutic techniques and this is an excellent opportunity to join a large collaborative research group with strong links to the University of Oxford. The University has recently opened a licensed GMP PET radiopharmacy facility which will provide tracers to the hospital for clinical and research purposes. The section also has strong collaborative relationships with several industry partners.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Candidates for this post must be registered Clinical Scientists and ideally be registered as MPE/DGSA. They will be strongly encouraged to participate in research and development projects and be very involved in the radiation protection support to departments. Experience of working in a clinical nuclear medicine department is essential. Candidates with less experience will be considered for employment at a lower band.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For informal discussion about the post, please contact Aida Hallam, Head of Radioisotope Physics on 01865 235341 (aida.hallam@ouh.nhs.uk)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Closing Date- 6th December 2020&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=120889"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "CH, Oxford", "postalCode": "OX3 7LE"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "51.7503", "longitude": "-1.21469"}}, "title": "Senior Clinical Scientist MPE Radioisotope Physics", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916250010", "validThrough": "2020-12-06T23:59:59+0000"}

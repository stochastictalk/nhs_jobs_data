From April 2020 Sirona engaged in a new 10 year NHS adult community contract, including the community musculoskeletal services, for Bristol, North Somerset, and South Gloucestershire (BNSSG). This post will therefore benefit from being fully integrated within the wider MSK pathway which includes first contact practitioners, interface service and secondary care.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When you join our friendly team you will have your own clinical caseload, assessing and rehabilitating patients through both face to face and virtual (video and telephone) consultations, and in gym settings. The team has an excellent induction, supervision and training framework which you will be engaged in immediately. You will also have the opportunity to support students, and be involved as we continually develop our university links and our placement models to better support student placements. We believe that developing good clinicians within a dynamic and enjoyable team environment is the best way to deliver a high quality and efficient service. You will also be part of the wider governance groups across the team which look at ways to innovate and improve how Sirona deliver physiotherapy services across BNSSG.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are excited to offer an opportunity to join our Bristol Musculoskeletal Physiotherapy team. The team works from various bases in Bristol, with the main bases being Hampton House and Knowle West Health Park. The post holder may be required to work from any of these bases. Further details regarding your base will be provided at interview. This may change during the course of their employment to meet service need and to enhance their own development. There may also be a requirement to support the South Gloucestershire and North Somerset Musculoskeletal Physiotherapy teams.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If you are excited by the prospect of joining our forward thinking team and being a key figure in the shaping of MSK services within Sirona please get in touch or follow the link to complete the application form.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The MSK physiotherapy clinics run core hours from Monday - Friday 8-8pm, excluding bank holidays. In the future there may be a requirement to extend core working hours of the service to up to 7-day working; however, a formal consultation process would be undertaken at such time this was being considered. At times of organisational escalation you would be expected to work anywhere across the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The post holder will:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Work well as part of a team.

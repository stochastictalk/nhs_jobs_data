With a growing network of 9 practices over 13 sites and 40 employed GPs, we are now recruiting to new opportunities for General Practitioners in our Crewkerne Practice.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Crewkerne Health Centre is a well-established, friendly, patient centred practice close to the Jurassic Coast and with beautiful surrounding countryside. It is a semi-rural Practice based in a Somerset market town with purpose-build premises and an in-house part-owned pharmacy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Practice joined the SHS team in July 2017. In July 2018 nearby West One Surgery joined SHS to become part of Crewkerne Health Centre as a second site. Our integrated team now provides a wide range of services to around 13,000 patients across the two locations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Crewkerne Health Centre is high achieving, with a stable population and a highly effective multi-disciplinary team including Nurse Practitioners, Emergency Care Practitioners and Health Coaches. We are also currently extending the team with the development of new Pharmacy roles.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The team are committed to a high standard of general practice, working in a integrated way across primary and secondary care and working closely with community staff who are co-located in the surgery. They are also working closely with all of the other four SHS Practices as part of the development of the South Somerset West Primary Care Network.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are now looking for an enthusiastic and committed GP to join our long established and highly motivated team at Crewkerne Health Centre. We have up to 9 sessions available and will consider part time applicants.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We offer our GPs a range of flexible working options together with a competitive remuneration package based on the BMA GP contract with additional incentive payments and further allowances for GPs with specialist skills and experience.

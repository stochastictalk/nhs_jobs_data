The acquisition of the community health and social care provider (Torbay and Southern Devon Health and Care NHS Trust) has allowed us to radically re-think and re-shape the way we deliver care, free from traditional organisational constraints. This post offers an opportunity to be part of designing and delivering innovative new services in Torbay and South Devon, including more integrated and streamlined care pathways for patients.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Torbay Hospital is a medium sized District General Hospital providing acute services to South Devon. We are situated about two miles from the centre of Torquay and virtually all facilities, including a Cancer Unit with two new linear accelerators, are concentrated on the one site.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are excellent opportunities for a variety of lifestyles and interests being close to both the Coast and Moorland. Torquay offers excellent state schools, with academic success at the highest levels for both A Levels and the international Baccalaureate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Torbay\u2019s Hospital Palliative Care Team requires a part time consultant (6PAs). This is a new post following the reduction in PAs of a substantive consultant.

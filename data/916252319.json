The role involves supporting the Deputy Director of Partnerships with operational management, from business planning, finance and developing our online hub for partners.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It would suit either a business support professional who would like to develop an understanding of marketing, or a marketing professional with a flair for financial management who is looking to develop team leadership skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Some experience of stakeholder management or marketing, as well as a good understanding of the local government or NHS context would be a real advantage.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For an informal discussion about the post, please email toni.bennett@phe.gov.uk&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Option 3 \u2013 External&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Open to all external applicants (anyone) from outside the Civil Service (including by definition internal applicants).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Applicants are strongly advised to use the criteria in the person specification (available online) as sub-headings in their application to make it clear how they meet each of the selection criteria, including required competencies, which are included at the back of the job description.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Public Health England promotes diversity in the workplace and is an equal opportunities employer&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On 18 August 2020, the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care announced plans to establish the National Institute for Health Protection and consult on the best future options for strengthening health improvement and other public health functions in the wider system. Public Health England and many of its employees will be in scope for transition to new organisations in Spring 2021. Any new or current employees working for Public Health England during this time, will receive appropriate communications and consultation prior to any formal transfer taking place. Employees who compulsorily transfer to successor bodies will remain on their existing contractual terms and conditions and this applies both to current employees and those recruited during the transition.

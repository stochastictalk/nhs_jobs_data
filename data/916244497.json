The aim is to provide a patient centred, holistic approach to their rehabilitation and recovery as they are discharged from Critical Care.\u00a0 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The service was trialled at St James Hospital in 2018, it demonstrated that if patients received extra rehabilitation and support, improved physiological and Psychological outcomes were achieved post ICU. This also reduced length of stay in hospital post ICU. Due to the success of the service we aim to roll it out cross site. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The role requires working within a small team to co -coordinate the day to day running of the service. This involves delegating tasks within the team, coordinating and communicating effectively with the wider multi-disciplinary team to set achievable individual goals for the patients and liaising with other inpatient services.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The team focuses on both Physiological and psychological rehabilitation equally, so an understanding of Post ICU syndrome is paramount to provide an effective patient centred approach to the role. Candidates should have an interest in the psychological wellbeing of patients; extra training within this area will be provided when commencing the role. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Experience within Critical Care is not essential but desirable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Job share/flexible working will be considered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is a really exciting time to join Critical Care Rehabilitation team, to be part of developing and shaping the future of the service.\u00a0 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Any Questions please contact : Catherine Lloyd ext:67605 or e-mail &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;catherine.lloyd11@nhs.net&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/123792.jpg", "name": "Adult Critical Care", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=123792"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "The Leeds General Infirmary", "postalCode": "LS1 3EX"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "53.8015", "longitude": "-1.55175"}}, "title": "Critical Care Rehabilitation Coordinator (XR06)", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916244497", "validThrough": "2020-11-11T23:59:59+0000"}

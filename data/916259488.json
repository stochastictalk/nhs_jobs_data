In addition, through its specialist networks and community clinic/drop-in services the Trust serves some three million people over a wider geographical area, including neighbouring counties and North Wales. The Trust comprises of two core sites: (1) The Royal Stoke University Hospital, which is a large acute teaching hospital on the border of Stoke-on-Trent and (2) The County Hospital in Stafford. The Trust also has major trauma status and deals with more than 116,000 trauma patients at the emergency centre.&lt;br /&gt;Keele University and UHNM host a School of Medicine with an annual intake of 130 undergraduate medical students. It has recently received prestigious commendations for its highly student-rated, innovative integrated MBChB five-year course committed to \u201cGraduating Excellent Clinicians\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Cardiology Sub-Specialties:&lt;br /&gt;Interventional Cardiology&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The interventional cardiology department is one of largest volume centres in the UK undertaking close to 2500 PCIs each year and a full range of structural interventions including TAVI, Mitraclip, ASD closures, Atrial appendage closures and paravalvular leak interventions and is a European Centre of excellence for radial PCI. There is a full range of imaging modalities such as OCT and IVUS, rotablation and laser and physiological assessment tools. The interventional cardiology service is amongst the most established in the country that has close to 2 decades track record of innovative radial research, radial conferences and is amongst the most published units in the UK with over 40 publications in high impact journals published each year. The centre has been the site of first in man studies / use of equipment and has a significant program of interventional clinical trial research.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Devices&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;UHNM offers a comprehensive device service, with 800 procedures performed last year. Devices are implanted in a dedicated pacing lab, which is being upgraded to a dedicated facility this year. Device extractions are undertaken in this lab using both LASER and mechanical systems with appropriate cardiothoracic support. The recent acquisition of a Sonosite allows safe axillary puncture techniques, and diathermy/plasma blade is used for implantation in anti-coagulated patients. The department implants over 350 ICD\u2019s annually, over 200 being CRT cases. There is also a full CRT optimisation service for appropriate patients. There are over 4500 device follow -up appointments per year. This encompasses follow-up of implantable loop recorders, which are implanted by a dedicated trained nurse. There is also a 24hr technical on-call service for all cardiac devices&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Heart failure&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The heart failure services has a nationally recognised day case Heart Failure unit (Shine Unit) supported by research funding from the Health Foundation seeing over 300 patients a year in a dedicated out patient unit. This unit offers holistic specialist care to a previously hospitalised population. Heart Failure is one of the key areas for co-morbidity research development identified by the Health Services Research Unit of Keele University. This has already led to grant funding from sources such as the NIHR and Health Foundation. There are also close links between the heart failure, imaging and device services.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Echocardiography/CMR/Cardiac CT/ Nuclear Cardiology&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Over 10,000 echoes are performed annually: including 350 TOE and 700 DSE. The department is equipped with 2 Vivid 7 machines (3D and Tissue Doppler along with speckle tracking) linked to a dedicated echo database (Echo Pac. A 3D TOE probe is awaited from GE. There are 3 Vivid I portable machines, and a further Vivid 7 (and another on order) used solely in the cardiothoracic Unit. Last year over 800 CMR scans were undertaken: the service is led by Dr Heatlie with a second scanner due in 2016. Finally a full range of nuclear investigations is undertaken: using 2 Siemens eCam\u2019s approx 2000 MIBI scans were performed last year.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Electrophysiology&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;UHNM provides tertiary centre EP to a 1.2 million population. There are state of the art facilities with a biplane cath lab equipped with Carto and Velocity electroanatomical mapping. UHMN offers the full range of electrophysiological investigations and treatments for both&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Key Areas/Tasks&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The post holder will be working with a team of Consultants, Specialty Doctors, Trust Doctors, Specialty Trainees, Core Trainees and Foundation Trainees. Each post has a generic clinical component in the relevant area. In addition the post holder will have an agreed experience in the specialty of their choice including outpatient clinics, ward cover, specialist in-patient reviews and procedures, audit and research. It is prudent to be a team player with excellent inter-personal skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The precise role within each team and the proportion of clinical time spent between the two components would depend on previous clinical experience and qualifications of the candidate and the specialty chosen. For candidates with more than 3 years of post-qualification experience, MRCP or equivalent qualifications, Senior Fellowship position can be offered depending on assessment at interview as well as knowledge, skills and aptitude as well as previous competencies achieved in the specialty.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The duties of this post will mirror that of the current middle grades interventional SPRs. It is not a Royal College recognised training post and does not carry a national training number. &lt;br /&gt;This is a clinical fellow post that will give the successful applicant experience and training in all areas of cardiology.&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "University Hospitals of North Midlands NHS Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=122653"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Newcastle-under-Lyme", "postalCode": "ST4 6QG"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "53.004", "longitude": "-2.21487"}}, "title": "Senior Training Fellow in Cardiology", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916259488", "validThrough": "2020-11-20T23:59:59+0000"}

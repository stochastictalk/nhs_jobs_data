If so, we are looking for Staff Nurses to become part of our multidisciplinary team.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Horizon Unit is a 38-bed unit in Horsham with close links to other community inpatient services.

To help our patients experience a high standard of care we also have input from community teams, Specialist Nurses, and a Consultant from our local acute Trust, all working together to support discharges from hospital.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Horizon is a friendly stand-alone unit. The care and therapy our patients receive is delivered through careful patient-centred assessment with involvement from the patients and their families. We are very lucky to have gardens which been adapted for use by patients, a therapy gym and a dayroom, enabling us to provide an extensive activity timetable to maximise patient recovery and ensure their admission is a positive experience for both them and their relatives. The feedback we have received from patients is that receiving care in this environment has been invaluable to them on their journey after an acute event.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our recent Care Quality Commission inspection rated our community inpatient services as &lt;strong&gt;Outstanding&lt;/strong&gt; for Caring and our overall Trust rating as &lt;strong&gt;Good&lt;/strong&gt;.

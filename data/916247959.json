While CBT for Psychosis and Family work are core elements of the provision, we are interested in the application of other approaches, such as CAT, CFT, ACT and Mindfulness, where appropriate.

The pathway operates for all people experiencing psychosis in Haringey regardless of the care team providing the service.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Within the Psychosis Pathway you will provide psychological assessments, consultations and formulations for other patients.

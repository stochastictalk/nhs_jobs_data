This is even more of a priority following the recent COVID-19 pandemic which has led to an enormous amount of change in policy and practice across the trust and as a result a higher risk to patients and staff.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This will involve working across all divisions and care units, training and supporting teams to understand human and systems errors and work cohesively to mitigate harm to patients and staff within our organisation. The successful candidate will positively contribute to an open culture and unite staff wellbeing initiatives across the Trust. This will enable clinical and non-clinical staff to embed a Human Factors approach to their domain, facilitating the optimisation of safety.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This post is open to both clinical and non-clinical staff at band 6 or above currently, who can demonstrate experience of staff development and training and effecting culture change. As part of your application, in the additional information section, we ask that you include a 500 word narrative as to why you feel you possess the skills to deliver on our above objectives.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For further details / informal visits contact:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;NameDr Helen MooreJob titleConsultant Clnical Educator, Learning Quality LeadEmail addresshmoore3@nhs.net&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/124072.jpg", "name": "Chesterfield Royal Hospital NHS Foundation Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=124072"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Chesterfield Royal Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Chesterfield", "postalCode": "S44 5BL"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "53.2362", "longitude": "-1.40008"}}, "title": "Training Lead for Human Factors and Patient Safety Syllabus", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916240199", "validThrough": "2020-11-14T23:59:59+0000"}

For the first time, we are working as a system with health and social care partners to deliver a truly integrated service for older people, spanning Birmingham and Solihull as part of the STP \u2018Ageing Well\u2019 strategy. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The recent acute Trust merger has led to further developments within our specialty becoming a transformation priority. Our vision is for older people to be as happy and healthy as possible, living self-sufficient, independent lives, able to have choice and control over what they do and what happens to them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We expect our workforce, at all grades and professions to be highly skilled and motivated, delivering individualised care to older people at the time they need it, and in the best possible place for them, which could be within their own home, or a hospital bed. Such personalised care also encompasses the needs of the person\u2019s support network, including carers, family, friends and the wider community. Birmingham is a diverse city, and we recognise that we have to work in a joined-up way, both internally and with our partners to deliver the best outcomes for patients and the communities we serve.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;We are looking for enthusiastic individual who will bring their skills, knowledge and experience to our existing teams in the continued development of the department.

We ensure that our staff are supported and are the only Trust in the UK to offer a Transition Programme which gives our nurses the knowledge and skills to take their care to the community. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you have joined the Trust, this programme will ensure that you are fully able to provide outstanding care to our patients in the community. You will receive excellent training and opportunities for development, clinical supervision and appraisals. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust is the first Trust in the UK to trial a new model of District Nursing known as the Buurtzorg Model, an entirely Nurse-led approach to patient care in the community with self managed nursing teams. The future of District Nursing at our Trust will be revolutionary. We are currently moving forward with this model so in the future you will find yourself working in a completely different way. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Closing Date: 8th November 2020 (midnight)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Interview Date: 18th November 2020&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For further details / informal visits contact:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;NameKaren JacksonAdditional contact information&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Karen Jackson on karen.jackson@gstt.nhs.uk&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Lucia Ricci on EllaLucia.Ricci@gstt.nhs.uk&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/121066.jpg", "name": "Guy's and St. Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=121066"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Community, London", "postalCode": "SE1 9RT"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "51.5046", "longitude": "-.088964"}}, "title": "Staff Nurse - Community", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916242754", "validThrough": "2020-11-08T23:59:59+0000"}

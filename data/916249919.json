The elective ward offers tremendous learning opportunities and is managed by our proactive manager Sister Sally Short.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The other 2 wards, ASU and B5 only have minimal vacancies which shows the excellent teams and working environment. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why not call for an informal chat to discuss further. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A career within a surgical environment offers a wide range of learning opportunities and our Ward Managers will work with you to create your own individualized development plan. This does include a certain element of flexible working where appropriate. The surgical unit has undergone substantial development and staff wellbeing and training are at the forefront of the Matron\u2019s itinerary.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All staff are actively encouraged to progress with all extended skills in order to become autonomous practitioners within a great team environment.

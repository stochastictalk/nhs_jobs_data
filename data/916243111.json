The BCHFT Physical Health Psychology Service currently operates across 3 geographical patches (Dudley, Wolverhampton and Sandwell and West Birmingham) with a number of contracts in each area. This post will be based at Whitmore Reans Health Centre / New Cross Hospital, Wolverhampton.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An exciting opportunity has arisen to recruit a Clinical / Counselling Psychologist to work alongside our colleagues in Wolverhampton Renal Services. Emotional and psychological support is an integral component of the care provided by the team. The post holder will be supported by a part time psychological counsellor in providing specialist psychological care provision. The post-holder will enjoy considerable variety within their role, providing bespoke psychological input for patients and their families; group interventions; live donor assessments; team formulation and consultation; and promoting psychologically-informed care in outpatient and hospital settings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are seeking a highly motivated and dynamic individual with a keenness and ability to integrate your current skills and apply them in this context. Prior experience of working in physical health is not essential - the most important qualities are good communication skills, working co-operatively and thinking creatively.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The post-holder will be joining a supportive and forward-thinking team of psychological professionals who pride themselves on their commitment to the continual development and improvement of patient care. Team members hold a range of therapeutic interests including Cognitive Behavioural, Third Wave, Narrative and Psychodynamic approaches. Clinical and leadership supervision, and continuing professional development, are highly valued, with the wider Physical Health Psychology community coming together every six months for Summer and Winter CPD workshops. Additionally, there are opportunities to join Narrative peer supervision and other groups. We are able to offer great opportunities for career progression, with many members of the service seeking and successfully securing promotions. The post will have active links with, and support from, both the wider Physical Health Psychology Service and psychological professionals within Trust mental health services.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The post holder will have opportunities for personal support and development via the Trust appraisal system.

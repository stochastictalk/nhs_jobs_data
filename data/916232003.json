This is a new post arising as a result of further investment in community services in Somerset NHS Foundation Trust.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Last year the Trust made the decision to begin providing additional dual diagnosis expertise within the Assertive Outreach Service due to the high percentage of assertive outreach clients with substance misuse issues.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you are successful in securing this post you will cover all of the county liaising carefully with the Trust\u2019s Assertive Outreach Service manager.

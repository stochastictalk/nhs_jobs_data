We are part of the Medical Division. We accept patients from the ED, AAU and occasionally ITU. We deliver excellent patient care in a challenging and motivated workplace.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our aim is to maximise patient care, by using all the resources available, to reduce length of hospital stay and maintain patient flow. This is achieved by holding a daily multi disciplinary meeting, to discuss every patient. The Hospital Intervention Team, Social Services, both medical teams and the nursing staff, meet to establish the needs of the patient, the management plan and how a safe discharge can be achieved in the most timely manner .&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The respiratory patients often undertake diagnostic and interventional procedures on the ward, and the ward is equipped with a negative pressure room for patients with more serious respiratory problems. Baird ward also cares for patients needing CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure) and BIPAP (Bi-level Positive Airway Pressure), occasionally we have patients who require tracheostomy care. We are also supported by the Macmillan specialist nurses for those patients who have been diagnosed with cancer or are currently having treatment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The acute medical patients can present with a variety of problems, such as sepsis and substance misuse, and for acutely unstable patients, we are able to offer cardiac monitoring. There is constant interaction between medical and nursing staff, which cultivates a supportive environment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are looking for an experienced Sister/Charge Nurse to complete our team, who will provide strong leadership, excellent communication skills and the ability to develop and support students and staff with clinical expertise.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The successful applicant will be expected to function effectively under pressure without compromising basic standards of care and professionalism. In return we will offer you excellent managerial support and commitment to your personal professional development.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You will need at least two years experience in an acute setting at Band 5, and ENB 998(Mentorship) or the equivalent, opportunities for further education will be available.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We also work closely with the University of Brighton and offer valuable management placements for nursing students.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For further details / informal visits contact:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Cheryl Baxter&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Matron&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;cheryl.baxter@nhs.net&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/120634.jpg", "name": "East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=120634"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Conquest Hospital, St Leonards on Sea", "postalCode": "TN37 7RD"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "50.8854", "longitude": ".567737"}}, "title": "Sister/Charge Nurse - Baird Ward", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916249191", "validThrough": "2020-11-12T23:59:59+0000"}

Look no further. Together with our partner City, University of London we can help return you to the nursing profession.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We have a number of opportunities for previously Registered Nurses who would like to undertake a Return to Practice nursing course and then immediately resume their career as a Band 5 nurse.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We work closely with our partner at City, University of London to offer and support re-registration through the completion of a Return to Practice (RTP) course. The next course date is: 27th January 2021.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There are two pathways for this programme: Voluntary and employed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The voluntary pathway allows you to complete the required placement hours on a non-paid voluntary basis at your chosen hours per week. City, University of London will process all DBS and occupational health checks for this route. Upon successful completion of the course you can apply for a Band 5 post.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The employed pathway allows you to be employed and paid as a band 3 for the required placement and theory hours.

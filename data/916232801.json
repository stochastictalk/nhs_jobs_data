These roles are available because of an expansion of our Health Protection Teams designed to support the service during a time of heightened activity due to the Covid-19 Incident Response.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;PHE is immersed in protecting the nation\u2019s health during a global pandemic. This is an interesting opportunity to gain experience working as a Health Protection Practitioner at a very busy and important time. While we are working hard to control and prevent the spread of Covid-19, we also need to continue to prevent and control the spread of other communicable diseases in our local areas.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Candidates for these positions will need to be able to adapt quickly to the changing shape of the local incident response over the months as we respond to new learning and research, developments in the science, new guidance and rules in relation to Covid-19.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You will need to demonstrate that you meet the essential requirements of the job descriptions and that you are:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Creative and dynamic.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Resilient and not fazed by the need to work at pace and in a fast-changing world.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The post holders will be responsible for dealing with the surveillance, prevention and control of communicable disease. This could involve working solely on the Covid-19 response or having a county-based portfolio of work covering the breadth of communicable diseases. They will provide specialist advice and support to stakeholders and may be expected to respond to a range of health protection incidents.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To apply you must be a Registered General Nurse, Environmental Health Practitioner or Allied Health Care Professional with experience working in your previous specialty. Two job descriptions are attached, to reflect the different entry qualifications in to this role.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The posts are located at Seaton House, Nottingham or at St Philips Place, Birmingham or Stafford. During the Covid-19 response, staff are currently working remotely with the need to work in the office from time to time, depending on the tasks associated with the role you take up. For example, this could be to support induction of a new starter or to help manage changes to an office building. We have implemented social distancing measures in the office for those who need to use the facilities.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Option 3 \u2013 External&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Open to all external applicants (anyone) from outside the Civil Service (including by definition internal applicants).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For further details / informal visits contact:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For further information or an informal chat about the roles please contact EMRecruitment.Covid19@phe.gov.uk.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/127774.jpg", "name": "Public Health England", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=127774"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Nottingham, Birmingham or Stafford, Nottingham, Birmingham or Stafford", "postalCode": "NG2 4LA"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "52.9493", "longitude": "-1.13867"}}, "title": "Health Protection Practitioner (Level 1)", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916232801", "validThrough": "2020-11-08T23:59:59+0000"}

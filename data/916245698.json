They also provide an alternative to admission, providing a step-up to specialist pathways, increasing support to CYP and their families as needed and a step-down from inpatient care to reduce the length of stay. They also work proactively for young people that can be harder to reach and provide a wraparound service working with colleagues in partner agencies and play a key part of developing multiagency risk-management plans for high-risk vulnerable CYP.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The service provides a range of therapeutic approaches including Dialectic Behavioural Therapy (DBT) and Brief Solution Focussed Therapy. Clinical supervision and Clinical Professional Development (CPD) are high priorities for the service as are principles of CYP IAPT.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Child and Adolescent Mental Health expertise and experience is desirable, but NOT essential as we recognise that expertise and experience in adult mental health is transferable.

As a Support Worker, you\u2019ll make a real difference to their lives as you provide support and advice to help each and every one of our service users achieve their potential. Passionate about people, you\u2019ll enjoy the scope and support to enhance your own life too, as you make this role your own as part of a hard-working and friendly team.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Role Responsibility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As one of our Support Workers, you\u2019ll be 100% committed to making sure that people with substance misuse problems have the best start at the very outset of their journey to independent living.

Although previous relevant experience, on either a voluntary basis or as a paid employee is preferable, most important is that you\u2019re flexible, patient and able to view situations from a service user\u2019s perspective. As you\u2019d expect, good moral values will be key. Situations can sometimes be difficult and challenging, so you\u2019ll need to be non-judgemental, with a sensitive approach and a good understanding of how to meet complex needs related to substance misuse.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At a practical level, you\u2019ll need good IT and communication skills.\u00a0 On top of our regular 9-5 service hours, you must also be prepared to work one late evening and Saturday mornings on a rota basis.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Running services on a not-for-profit basis, we invest every penny back into our care \u2013 and our people. So, if you\u2019re ambitious and focused on helping people with substance misuse issues, progress a Support Worker role with real value.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About us&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why Turning Point?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a leading health and social care provider with more than 300 locations across England, we take real pride in the services we offer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Across the varied regions, sectors and settings we operate within, our organisation is held together by a shared vision \u2013 and our people are connected by the same values. These include belief in potential, confidence in communication, embracing positive change and always treating each other as individuals.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We run all of our services on a not-for-profit basis; instead, we invest every penny back into our services and people.

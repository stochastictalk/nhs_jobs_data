Our model of care is our Wellbeing Approach \u2013 an integrated, comprehensive approach in recognition of the fact prisoners are a socially-excluded group with healthcare needs which are complex and often associated with poor outcomes. It adopts the premise no single health/wellbeing factor can be taken in isolation of other motivational issues which might impact a person\u2019s care.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;Two Placements, One Job...&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HMP Portland and HMP The Verne...

HMP The Verne is a 580 place prison for people on longer sentences who have been convicted of sexual offences.

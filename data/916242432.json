South Central Ambulance Service is committed to providing high levels of patient care in a pre-hospital environment and is focussed on delivering the right care at the right time to our patients.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key to the delivery of these services will be through the expansion of specialist clinical roles, one of which is the Qualified Specialist Practitioner \u2013 Primary Care (paramedic). &lt;/strong&gt;We are therefore seeking applications from registered paramedics who have the relevant pre-hospital operational clinical experience and hold a Specialist Qualification or equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are looking for qualified specialist practitioners, who are enthusiastic, dynamic and highly motivated. Applicants need to be excellent communicators with effective influencing and negotiating skills. You will be working with multi-disciplinary teams across the NHS landscape in order to ensure that appropriate care is provided for patients.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This exciting opportunity involves the successful completion of a \u2018Primary Care Development Programme\u2019.

Successful candidates will undertake the above outlined educational programme. This will be a blended learning experience, which will include leadership training and clinical placements alongside operational practice.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Specialist Paramedics will use their knowledge and skills to independently provide healthcare, focused to patients with minor illness or injury, long term conditions, and other urgent and primary care needs&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;As part of this role, new and exciting opportunities have arisen for rotational and collaborative working partnerships across the wider health care system; these include urgent care, primary care and community care settings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We can offer a wide range of flexibility/shift patterns to accommodate an effective work-life balance, as well as further development opportunities such as independent prescribing and advanced clinical practice modules at postgraduate level, for the right candidate.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Specialist will be responsible for the care of the patient including assessment, diagnosis, treatment, discharge and/or referral as well as administering and supplying medicines, in line with Patient Group Directions/Medicines management policy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You will be expected to demonstrate evidence of taking personal responsibility for your own professional development, leadership in a clinical environment and have a strong desire to support and guide colleagues in other clinical roles.

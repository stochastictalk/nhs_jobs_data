The posts are open to any nurse with an interest in student learning, and would be a fantastic development opportunity for Band 5 nurses wanting experience of Trust-wide working, or opportunities to broaden their professional portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This role is being offered as 12 month, fixed-term contract (perfect for a secondment), funded by Health Education England as part of a national campaign to develop and expand high quality placement experiences for student nurses and other clinical learners.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The post will focus on helping teams to support more students in a safe, effective and meaningful way. This will involve helping to implement new models of mentorship (such as \u2018Collaborative Learning in Practice\u2019), and expanding placements into non-nursing settings both within and outside of AWP.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a full-time opportunity (Monday to Friday 9-5), although some flexibility is preferred in order to accommodate the needs of clinical teams and their learners. Ability to travel Trust-wide is also required, although (due to the current COVID-19 pandemic) the work will rely heavily on remote working and video-conferencing platforms.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you think these roles could be the way forward for you, please make contact with the AWP Nursing Careers and Professional Standards Team by emailing Emily.carnell@nhs.net&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For further details / informal visits contact:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Emily Carnell, Pre Registration Co-ordinator&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;emily.carnell@nhs.net&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;0117 378 4664&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/121159.jpg", "name": "Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership NHS Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=121159"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Fromeside (Trustwide), Bristol", "postalCode": "BS16 2EW"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "51.4831", "longitude": "-2.53883"}}, "title": "Band 6 - Development Practice Education Facilitator", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916259291", "validThrough": "2020-11-22T23:59:59+0000"}

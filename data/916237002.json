Consequently, an exciting opportunity has arisen for a passionate and highly motivated &lt;strong&gt;Care Coordinator&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; (Band 6)&lt;/strong&gt; from either a nursing, occupational therapy or social work background to join our team, working in Nottingham City.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The EIP service in Nottinghamshire is delivered through a multidisciplinary team of practitioners who provide comprehensive assessments and evidence-based treatments for people aged 14-65 who are experiencing a First Episode Psychosis (FEP) or an At Risk Mental State (ARMS) for the development of psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You will join a dedicated, enthusiastic and supportive team to ensure the timely assessment of service users referred and formulate recovery focused care plans and relapse prevention plans in collaboration with the person. You will also provide specialist evidence-based interventions, including Family Interventions, to those supported by the service and you will use standard outcome measures to monitor recovery and adjust your care / treatment plans accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You will have a keen interest in working with the client groups served by EIP and a desire to effectively support their families.

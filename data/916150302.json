Many of these patients are given thrombolysis treatment on the unit and if indicated may receive intra-arterial clot retrieval (mechanical thrombectomy) which has shown greatly improved patient outcomes in recent studies.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a particularly exciting time to join our team as we&#39;ve recently implemented a mechanical thrombectomy service for the region. HASU is a dynamic and fast paced area of work where you can develop and utilise acute nursing skills.

Common conditions we see are brain bleeds, tumours, head injuries, seizures, myasthenia gravis and guillain-barre syndrome amongst many others.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We also take emergency spinal admissions when our sister spinal ward is at full capacity. One of our beds is also a specialist video-telemetry (VT) Suite whereby epilepsy patients are monitored for a week, often reducing medication to promote seizures. This is for either diagnostic measures or to assess whether they would be a candidate for surgery.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;F4 SPINAL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Wessex spinal unit, opened in April 2015.We have 22 beds which take both elective and emergency spinal patients.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D AND E NEURO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;D neuro (male) and E neuro (female) each house 24 beds.

The programme covers all common neurology and neurosurgery conditions such as stroke, head injury, epilepsy, neuro-oncology and spinal pathology.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Whilst studying for the course we are able to offer a rotation within the Wessex neurological centre or you could be based in a speciality area.

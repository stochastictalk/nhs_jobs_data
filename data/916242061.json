A key element of the team\u2019s remit includes leading on the reconfiguration of a number of Specialties, by collaborating with other NWL providers, to ensure the best model of care is delivered.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This role will focus on the Specialty Review Programme (SRP), which is a core component of our approach to embedding sustainable change across the Trust and collaborations across our health economy. It is our unique, clinically led programme designed to ensure that all our clinical specialties are providing high quality care for our patients.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our approach is simple, but effective, in helping Specialities to achieve their vision. It is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Assess the current state&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Design the future state&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Develop a plan to achieve the future state &amp;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Implement that plan&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The role will lead Specialties through this process and ultimately through to implementation. You will have experience of implementing large scale transformation projects and be able to hit the ground running. It is an opportunity to affect real change within our Trust, and NW London, and ultimately improve the lives of our patients.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The role is for 1 year fixed term contract covering maternity leave. The Trust is able to fund up to 3 days a week but we are open to full time applicants, if your current employer is able to subsidise the additional 2 days.

Patients referred for inpatient treatment are at a very low weight and have a high degree of physical and psychiatric co-morbidity.

We are looking for individuals who are willing to develop a range of skills in a challenging yet rewarding role, including an ability to hold a boundary, to enable the patient to resist their eating disorder behaviours and work towards recovery. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We always strive to provide exceptional care to our patients, so are looking for staff who work towards high professional standards and who always act in line with our Trust values of care, compassion, integrity and trust.

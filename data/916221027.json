The successful candidates will work at Step 3 of the Stepped Care Model, providing assessments and NICE approved therapies across the locality, including face to face and telephone work. The posts are clinically supervised by senior clinicians in the service and are operationally responsible to the Senior CBT Therapist.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Previous experience working in an IAPT or equivalent service would be beneficial, as would further training in IAPT approved therapies such as IPT or EMDR and IAPT Supervisor Training. People with lived experience of mental health issues are encouraged to apply for these posts.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The service offers therapy opportunities for clients between the hours of 8am-8pm and in future, also at weekends. Successful candidates must be prepared to work flexibly to meet service needs within these hours. Due to service demands, these posts are not suitable for job share.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For further details, please contact:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Brian Rich (Senior CBT Therapist/LTC Lead Tamworth) 01827 263838 Brian.Rich@mpft.nhs.uk&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Donna Craddock (Senior CBT Therapist/Operational Lead Burton) 01283 504872 Donna.Craddock@mpft.nhs.uk&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Judy Thacker (Senior CBT Therapist/Operational Lead Cannock) 01543 479101 Judith.Thacker@mpft.nhs.uk&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Midlands Partnership NHS Foundation Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=121040"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Cannock, Burton, Stafford, Tamworth", "postalCode": "DE14 1JS"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "52.804", "longitude": "-1.62915"}}, "title": "High Intensity CBT Therapist", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916221027", "validThrough": "2020-11-16T23:59:59+0000"}

Liaison mental health services are designed to operate away from traditional mental health settings, in the main in acute care general hospital emergency departments and wards, and medical and surgical outpatients. There is a growing evidence base for the clinical and cost effectiveness of Mental Health Liaison Services (MHLS). Working within the National CORE24 strategy, BCHFT has been commissioned to provide 4 newly configured, multi-disciplinary, MHLS teams across the Black Country Sustainability and Transformation Partnership (STP).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Black Country STP is currently served by 4 acute hospital Trusts, each providing general hospital inpatient services and emergency departments. The 4 acute hospital Trusts are:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The Dudley Group Foundation Trust,&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust,&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The Royal Wolverhampton Trust and&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Between them these trusts have a total of over 2000 inpatient beds across their sites.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are currently seeking 2.0 WTE Senior Applied Psychologists (Clinical / Counselling / Forensic) to work across our 4 new Mental Health liaison teams within these acute hospital trusts.

One post holder will work across the Wolverhampton / Walsall teams (based at New Cross Hospital and Walsall Manor Hospitals respectively) whilst the other post holder will work across the Sandwell and Dudley teams (based at Sandwell District General Hospital and Russell\u2019s Hall Hospital respectively). Although urgent care psychology services have, for some time, supported the work of the liaison teams through offers of regular reflective practice, this will be an exciting new opportunity to expand, develop and consolidate psychology input into these teams.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Working with nursing and psychiatry colleagues the successful post holders will work towards ensuring successful outcome&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/120845.png", "name": "Black Country Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust (formerly known as Black Country Partnership Foundation Trust)", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=120845"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "General Hospitals in Acute Trusts - varied, Varied", "postalCode": "WV10 0QP"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "52.5977", "longitude": "-2.09594"}}, "title": "Applied Senior Psychologist", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916243037", "validThrough": "2020-11-08T23:59:59+0000"}

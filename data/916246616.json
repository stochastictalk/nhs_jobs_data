Other community service developments include an expansion of the innovative offender personality disorder services in Northumberland, Tees Valley and Cumbria.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This post is based primarily in the medium secure (mental health) hospital and community/out-patient services in conducting collaborative assessment and formulation of risk and needs and delivering, designing and evaluating individual and group-based interventions. However, as with all of our psychology posts a degree of cross-service input is included. However, The services have a commitment to staff wellbeing and development and there are opportunities to contribute to training and research.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The secure care psychological services have research and academic links with both Newcastle and Northumbria Universities and provide teaching and training placements for clinical, forensic and counselling psychology trainees, including those from overseas. Psychology Services within the Trust are highly valued and there is active support for CPD activities for all grades of staff.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For further details / informal visits contact:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Name: Gail McGregor\u00a0 Job title: Consultant Psychologist&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Email address: gail.mcgregor@cntw.nhs.uk \u00a0 Telephone number: 0191 246 7269&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/121049.jpg", "name": "Cumbria, Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS Foundation Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=121049"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "St Nicholas Hospital, Gosforth", "postalCode": "NE3 3XT"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "55.0063", "longitude": "-1.63477"}}, "title": "Clinical Psychologist", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916246616", "validThrough": "2020-11-11T23:59:59+0000"}

There is opportunity to negotiate a flexible working pattern to ensure a longer term and sustainable career in the Specialty.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Great Western Hospital also encourages development of Medical Staff, it might therefore be possible to undertake sponsored development opportunities such as Diplomas or other qualifications.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Great Western Hospital is proud to support many varied NIHR Portfolio and Commercially funded Research Studies. We have an active Research &amp; Innovation Department in place to support you with both the Multi-Specialty Clinical Delivery and Research Management &amp; Governance elements.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Great Western Hospital is a modern building set in beautiful surroundings on the outskirts of Swindon.

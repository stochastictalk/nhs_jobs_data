This post is to cover service need and designed to offer a doctor further experience in dermatology.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Norwich is home to our beautiful, purpose built hospital which is the 6th largest Acute Trust in the UK. Located on the same site as Norwich Research Park and next to world renowned University of East Anglia (UEA), we are a teaching hospital with a strong focus around career development and research.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Norwich?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In Norwich a staggering 77% of people say they love their job. Less than 2 hours from London (yet a world away in terms of house prices and cost of living) and serviced by excellent transport links, Norwich is one of few UK cities that still retain a strong local identity and with that a strong sense of community \u2013 people walk down the street and say hello to each other, baristas remember our coffee order, you get to know about interesting local projects.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This strong sense of self along with excellent shopping, eating out, affordable house prices and excellent schooling is why Norwich has been ranked by the Guardian as the best city to work in.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The quality of life in Norwich is very high. House prices are very reasonable. One can live within walking distance of the city centre without breaking the bank. Similarly, one can live in countryside with only short commute to the hospital either by car or bike. Norwich as a city ticks a lot of boxes. It has excellent schools. Crime is low and one feels safe walking around. The historical aspects of Norwich remain very obvious with its city walls, medieval street plan and a Norman cathedral. Sport is good with a premiership football team. There is a vibrant arts scene with an annual festival and both professional and amateur theatre and music. In short, Norwich is one of Britain\u2019s best kept secrets.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wish you were here?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So do we\u2026..&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In return we can offer a suite of benefits including&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;On site nursery&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Variety of onsite restaurants, cafes and deli\u2019s&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Access to an excellent on site library&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Dedicated workplace health and well-being services including sports clubs, counselling support and discounted complimentary therapy service.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the Trust and the opportunities we can offer, please visit our web site then follow the link to working for us.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Or for further information contact Dr Anila Kapadia, Consultant using email : Anila.Kapadia@nnuh.nhs.uk&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/122492.jpg", "name": "Norfolk and Norwich University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=122492"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Norfolk &amp; Norwich University Hospital, Norwich", "postalCode": "NR4 7UY"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "52.6181", "longitude": "1.22109"}}, "title": "Senior Clinical Fellow in Dermatology", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916258663", "validThrough": "2020-11-19T23:59:59+0000"}

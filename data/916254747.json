An exciting new post has become available in our busy Gynaecology Outpatients department for a deputy sister to join our team. If you want to work within a supportive environment providing care for women with a wide range of gynaecological conditions to support the pre operative assessment team to ensure women are fit for surgery, then this could be the post for you. We provide a service for women with a variety of conditions including, infertility, urogynaecology, menstrual disorders, endometriosis and an urgent two week wait service for post-menopausal bleeding. Within this 2 week wait service you will be expected to work alongside the doctors offering hysteroscopic investigations to investigate the lining of the uterus. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You will be expected to work as part of a team in order to provide a comprehensive, efficient service for women. You will support the department sister in managing the service and the team, carrying out appraisals, return to work discussions and supporting the team in being compliant with all their training. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You will receive an annual appraisal and a personal development plan to enable you to have structure within your role.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This daytime post is for 31 hours per week, mostly Monday to Friday although there will be occasional evening and Saturday clinics. Previous gynaecology experience would be an advantage; however training will be given to the successful candidate.

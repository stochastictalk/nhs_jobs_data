This will enable the traditional barriers to the delivery of health and care to be broken down to enable care to be delivered to a defined patient population, in a different way to meet the needs of that population, focused on prevention and personalisation of care, making best use of resources collectively.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The NHS Long Term Plan introduced PCNs as essential building blocks of every Integrated Care System. The postholder will have responsibility for leading and managing the community nursing workforce.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The community staff nurse will be attached to a caseload of patients where responsibility lies with the District Nursing Sister within a PCN. This role will provide the opportunity to work closely with GP practices and other partners, in supporting patients with highly complex and often high acuity needs to prevent unnecessary hospital admission. This role requires an clinician with excellent, team working and communication skills, to provide patient centred care and delivering effective evidence based care to a defined demographic population with diverse health care and social needs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The successful candidate need to be prepared to adapt to the changing needs of the Trust and the community models of care as they arise.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The centre is committed to providing the right candidate with a development programme that will not only enhance their academic qualifications and nursing interests, but will also provide an excellent foundation for professional development, as well as gaining an insight into the intra-organisational structure and processes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For further details / informal visits contact:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;NameTheresa GillJob titleClinical LeadEmail addresstheresa.gill@nhs.netTelephone number07970 199324&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/120671.jpg", "name": "South Tees Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=120671"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Low Grange Health Village, Redcar and Cleveland area", "postalCode": "TS6 6TD"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "54.5707", "longitude": "-1.16757"}}, "title": "Community Staff Nurse", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916258076", "validThrough": "2020-11-19T23:59:59+0000"}

Facilities at our base hospital, Worcestershire Royal Hospital, include specialist physiotherapy (including musculoskeletal ultrasound), occupational therapy, a large hydrotherapy pool, the Rheumatology Day Case Unit, and access to in-patient beds for acute admissions. Therapy support services are also available at the Kidderminster Treatment Centre and the Alexandra Hospital in Redditch.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is an exciting time as we re-think service delivery post Covid and expand collaboration with our health economy partners.

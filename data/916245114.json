The post holder will be based at Newcastle University School of Dental Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Part-funded Academic Clinical Fellowships (ACFs) are 3 year fixed-term national training posts. Trainees undertake 25% academic training over the term of the post. They will continue to spend the remaining 75% in their separate post working clinically in General Dental Practice/CDS.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;ACF trainees undertake a Research Training Programme provided by the University for which funding is provided by NIHR. They also are eligible for a \u00a31,000 bursary per year to support research training activity (eg. to attend academic conferences).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;ACF trainees would also normally complete and submit an external funding application for a research fellowship to enable them to complete a higher degree (PhD or research MD) following the completion of their ACF fixed-term post,&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All Academic Clinical Fellowships are run-through posts. A trainee entering ACF would therefore be guaranteed continued training for 3 years, as long as they progress satisfactorily through their training via annual appraisal.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please note:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No clinical benchmarking is required for this post.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Applications will be restricted to those candidates who meet the eligibility and entry criteria as outlined in the person specification.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Health Education England working across the North East and North Cumbria operates a \u2018lead employer\u2019 arrangement and all of our Academic Clinical Fellows are employed by the \u2018Lead Employer Trust\u2019 hosted by Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust for the duration of their training.&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Lead Employer for Northern Deanery", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=127674"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "North East &amp; North Cumbria", "postalCode": "NE15 8NY"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "54.9689", "longitude": "-1.71259"}}, "title": "Part-funded NIHR Academic Clinical Fellowship in GDP/CDS", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916245114", "validThrough": "2020-11-10T23:59:59+0000"}

Are you interested in shaping an expanding, multidisciplinary team within a regional adoption agency? We wish to appoint two dynamic and enthusiastic Occupational Therapists to provide occupational therapy expertise, knowledge and skills within the OAWY Multidisciplinary team (MDT). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One Adoption West Yorkshire (OAWY) is a shared regional adoption service across the 5 West Yorkshire Local Authorities. It is hosted by Leeds City Council with office bases across West Yorkshire and is responsible for the recruitment and assessment of adopters, family finding for children and adoption support. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The developing and expanding OAWY multidisciplinary team comprising therapeutic social workers, education professionals and health professionals, including psychologists, occupational therapists and a speech therapist. The team works in partnership with the wider adoption service to provide an integrated, multi-layered, inter agency service, focused on the individual needs of adopted children and their families, with an emphasis on early identification of issues, prevention and early intervention. The MDT supports OAWY and its partner agencies trough consultations and training. The team offers consultations, assessments and therapeutic support to children, young people and families. We strive to develop flexible partnership working models across health, education, and the voluntary and independent sectors. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Leeds Community Healthcare Trust is working in partnership with OAWY to employ healthcare professionals for the MDT and link them to an enthusiastic group of clinicians to provide professional support, collaborative learning and development opportunities to the post holders. The occupational therapy posts are hosted by LCH Integrated Children&#39;s Additional Needs (ICAN) service and while you will have links with colleagues within this service, your clinical work will be with OAWY. The supervision will be provided by Band 7 Occupational Therapists in the OAWY MDT. This is a fantastic opportunity for an OT who is interested in working with children and families who have experienced developmental trauma from a neurodevelopmental / sequential perspective.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We seek to understand and support the child with the ongoing impact of early adversity as well as to recognise and respond to additional difficulties such as neurodevelopmental, educational or familial issues. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As a developing team we are engaged in a dynamic process of continual improvement and development of the service, based on learning from direct work and feedback from families and staff. The service will offer an evidence based approach, building in robust outcome monitoring and review processes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As one of the Occupational Therapists in the team the main part of your role will be working with colleagues to improve understanding of children&#39;s physical, emotional and relational development and design and deliver support services such as Building Underdeveloped Sensorimotor Systems (BUSS) model*.

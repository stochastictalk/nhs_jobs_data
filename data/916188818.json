We are also innovating the traditional recovery approach, supporting patients during admission, pre-op and post operatively within our Medirooms. A new concept in Healthcare, our Medirooms combine the traditional recovery, day-case, same-day and admission areas into a single patient room environment, specifically designed to enhance patient experience by improving the level of privacy and dignity these areas were traditionally able to offer.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But it\u2019s not just our theatre departments which are impressive; our Trust itself is pioneering in its approach to healthcare.

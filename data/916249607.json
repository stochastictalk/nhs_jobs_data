We have 5 dedicated beds and an expanding domiciliary diagnostic service, performing more than 3000 studies per year. We also support Snow Leopard Long Term Ventilation patients, for whom we aspire to perform comprehensive sleep studies including NIV titration and other therapy optimisation. Within the same staff structure the respiratory assessment service was established in 2017 to support the expanding Respiratory Team and other disciplines within ELCH. The service has seen rapid growth and uses innovative approaches and equipment to maintain excellent patient experience for our paediatric population. The dedicated paediatric lab also provides mobile out-patient and ward testing and is currently developing pathways for home spirometry.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Two posts are available, one will focus primarily on respiratory physiology, the other on sleep physiology. After initial competencies are achieved in the primary discipline it is expected that all successful candidates will then follow a training framework that incorporates both. The primary discipline will be discussed at interview and agreed at the offer stage, it will depend upon previous experience, service requirement and candidate preference where possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The successful candidates will therefore gain training and experience in a wide range of investigations including spirometry, FeNO, forced oscillation technique, exhaled CO, sniff nasal inspiratory pressure measurements, transfer factor, lung volumes, bronchodilator reversibility assessments, overnight oximetry and continuous carbon dioxide studies, actigraphy, respiratory polygraphy and full polysomnography. They will also assist with more specialised measurements such as hypoxic challenge, structural light plethysmography, multiple sleep latency testing and combined sleep/telemetry studies. Attending and analysing overnight sleep studies is an essential part of this role, shifts therefore include a combination of 9am-5pm, 8am \u2013 4pm, 12.30pm-8.30pm and 8pm-8am, and approximately 20 - 30% of duties are worked outside normal hours (WONH).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Applicants should possess a BSc in clinical physiology or relevant science degree, some relevant work experience and a desire to work in sleep/respiratory physiology, as demonstrated by well written supporting information within the application. ARTP/BRPT qualifications are desirable but not essential. A personalised training programme will be designed and agreed during induction.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For further details/informal visits contact: Jane Orgill, Principal Sleep Physiologist, Children\u2019s Sleep and Respiratory Centre Tel: 020 7188 7188 x53309 email: jane.orgill@gstt.nhs.uk&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Closing Date: Wednesday 10th November at Midnight&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Interviews will be held on Thursday 19th November 2020.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For further details / informal visits contact:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;NameJane OrgillJob titlePrincipal PhysiologistEmail addressjane.orgill@gstt.nhs.ukTelephone number02071883427/02071887188 x53309Additional contact information&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/121066.jpg", "name": "Guy's and St. Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=121066"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "St Thomas Hospital, London", "postalCode": "SE1 7EH"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "51.4979", "longitude": "-.119645"}}, "title": "Paediatric Clinical Physiologist (Sleep and Respiratory)", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916249607", "validThrough": "2020-11-10T23:59:59+0000"}

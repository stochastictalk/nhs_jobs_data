This post presents a great opportunity to live and work in some of the finest landscape this country has to offer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Major cities such as Sheffield, Leeds, Nottingham and Derby are all within an hour\u2019s train journey, and local airports include East Midlands, Manchester and Leeds Bradford, with London within a couple of hours drive.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are excellent schools in the local area, only a few minutes from the hospital, as well as nursery childcare on-site.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We are a close-knit, supportive and friendly organisation where each of our 4200 members of staff are valued. We strongly believe that our employees are our greatest asset and so through Listening into Action (LiA), QSIR (Quality Service Improvement and Re-design), Human Factors and our Leading the Chesterfield Way leadership framework we engage our teams and empower everyone at all levels to initiate and bring about real improvements in our care.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chesterfield Hospital offers a full range of District General Hospital surgical specialities, including ENT, Maxillofacial, orthopaedics, paediatrics, and upper and lower GI. These are housed in a theatre suite consisting of twelve theatres, which has recently undergoing a major upgrade and refurbishment. It has a fifteen-bedded Critical Care Unit with ability to flex up to eighteen when required. It is anticipated that an expansion in the number of level 2 beds will occur within the next year to meet burgeoning demand. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Anaesthetic Department runs a core trainee rota covering mainly first on duty for theatres, registrar (or equivalent) rota covering Critical Care and a rota covering obstetric anaesthesia staffed by staff grades.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Since 1st January 1997, it has been a legal requirement that doctors must be recorded on the GMC Specialist Register in order to take up a consultant appointment in the NHS. Specialist Registrars in the U.K. are eligible to apply for a consultant appointment on or within six months of being admitted to the Specialist Register. All other categories of doctor, e.g., overseas-qualified specialists, must be on the Specialist Register before being eligible for consideration for appointment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The successful candidate will work for the Chesterfield Royal Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. As a consequence he/she is expected to work within the local policies, procedures, standing orders and standing financial instructions of the Trust. All medical and dental staff under contract to the Trust will be expected to comply with hospital health and safety policies.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Trust is committed to providing safe and effective care for patients. To ensure this, there is an agreed procedure for medical staff that enables them to report, quickly and confidentially, concerns about the conduct, performance or health of medical colleagues (Chief Medical Officer, December 1996). All medical staff practising in the Trust should ensure that they are familiar with the procedure and apply it as necessary.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The successful candidate would be anticipated to undertake on call duties on the general consultant on call rota, with daytime theatre cover. The exact content of this theatre cover can be decided in discussion with the clinical director and be adapted to personal interests which could include ENT, ophthalmology, and orthopaedics.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For further details / informal visits contact:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;NameMark WithersJob titleConsultant anaesthetistEmail addressm.withers@nhs.net&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/124072.jpg", "name": "Chesterfield Royal Hospital NHS Foundation Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=124072"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Chesterfield Royal Hospital, Chesterfield", "postalCode": "S44 5BL"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "53.2362", "longitude": "-1.40008"}}, "title": "Consultant anaesthetist with interest in obs", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916243797", "validThrough": "2020-11-24T23:59:59+0000"}

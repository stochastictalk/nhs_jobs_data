This is a fixed term appointment until 31&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;st&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; March, 2021.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Medical Workforce team is a small and friendly team dedicated to providing a broad range of Medical Workforce support to the medical staff across the organisation. The postholder will have the opportunity to gain experience across a broad range of Medical Workforce processes including medical locum bookings and rota planning. This range of duties means you will work in a role that offers both variety and plenty of opportunities for learning.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The post-holder will report into the Medical Workforce Co-ordinator and will be supported and developed on a day to day basis by the senior members of the team. Although the role is well supported, the ability to plan your workload and work autonomously will be expected.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Experience in Medical Workforce and the NHS would be an advantage but isn&#39;t essential, as long as you have experience in a similar working environment, as well as good administration and customer service skills.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Training in the role and in Medical Workforce matters will be provided to the successful applicant.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;We are committed to supporting our employees to achieve a good work life balance and as well as offering a supportive working environment, we are happy to consider flexible working applications.

Do you want to be a part of a dynamic multidisciplinary team?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An opportunity has arisen for you to join the Pembroke Suite team in Salisbury NHS Foundation Trust. This is a busy and demanding environment and the successful candidate will need to be a dynamic individual with the ability to build strong relationships and support the vision of our organisation. Critical requirements are a willingness to learn, improve the patient journey, support a strong approach to team working and drive to make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The successful candidate will also be required to work using their own initiative, yet be able to identify when to seek help and advice. You should have excellent communication and IT skills. Previous experience of working in a health care environment would be beneficial, but not essential, and full training will be given on appointment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Pembroke Suite is a day unit providing chemotherapy and supportive therapies to Oncology and Haematology patients. You will work alongside the nursing team and will communicate with Consultants, pharmacy, schedulers, secretaries and of course, patients. You will meet and greet patients when they attend the unit and capture the activity on our hospital system called Lorenzo. You will be the main point of contact for the Pembroke Suite, communicating queries and relaying information. You will work with and cross cover the Pembroke Ward clerk with regard to annual leave and sick leave. Due to the sensitivity and nature of our department, you will be polite and courteous while showing empathy at all times.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Although this is a fixed term contract, there may be potential to extend this in due course.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For further details / informal visits contact:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Phil Blackman, MCCU/Pembroke Unit Co-Ordinator, Admin Team Leader&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;philipblackman@nhs.net, 01722 336262 ext 3296&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/120765.jpg", "name": "Salisbury NHS Foundation Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=120765"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Salisbury NHS Foundation Trust, Salisbury", "postalCode": "SP2 8BJ"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "51.0439", "longitude": "-1.78981"}}, "title": "Pembroke Suite Administrator", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916240078", "validThrough": "2020-11-09T23:59:59+0000"}

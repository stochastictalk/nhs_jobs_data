The challenges that COVID 19 has generated in our ICS have been met with creative transformational solutions. Our team is part of those solutions; shaping and facilitating transformation and service redesign within clinical pathways.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Gloucestershire Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) is a dynamic organisation working in a fast-moving and ever changing environment. We are already making significant improvements in the delivery of health and health care services for our population of approximately 620,000.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Transformation and Service Redesign team work across clinical pathways via Clinical Programme Groups (CPGs). The CPGs follow a standardised approach to review current clinical pathways and ultimately design and deliver new and innovative ways of working.\u00a0 The strength of this approach is associated with the membership of the programme boards from clinicians, managers, public health representatives, patients, expert groups, voluntary sector providers and others, to consider the pathways from a variety of perspectives and to work together to deliver transformational change.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We have an exciting opportunity for a Programme Manager to join the CCG, within our directorate. The post holder will have an important role in linking with CPGs by leading on a portfolio of cross cutting themes identified by multiple CPGs. Working with project support staff the programme manager will give managerial leadership to the cross cutting programme areas forming a cooperative engagement with key stakeholders, defining a clear strategic direction, setting out plans for project delivery, coordinating redesign and ensuring successful implementation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you would like to discuss this post prior to applying please contact Adele Jones,\u00a0 Associate Director for Clinical Programmes on 07920 411658 or via adele.jones4@nhs.net&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Closing date for applications: Monday 16th November&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Interview date: Friday 27th November&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/128636.png", "name": "Gloucestershire Clinical Commissioning Group", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=128636"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Gloucester", "postalCode": "GL3 4FE"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "51.8485", "longitude": "-2.17476"}}, "title": "Programme Manager", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916249657", "validThrough": "2020-11-16T23:59:59+0000"}

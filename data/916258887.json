There are three successful birth centres, a home birth service and the central birth suite. Low risk women are cared for at the birth centres whilst ladies requiring consultant led care are offered excellent facilities and birth choices on the central birth suite setting.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Currently, our continuity of carer pathway is underway in line with Better Births. This model of care enables midwives to lead and progress with all aspects of midwifery practice while offering continuity of care to women and their families.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We require experienced and newly qualified midwives to work alongside the integrated midwifery teams within both the hospital and the community settings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We take great pride in the excellent preceptorship package which we offer to our newly qualified midwives and midwives joining from other Trusts.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For further details / informal visits contact:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;NameRebecca SessionsEmail addressRebecca.Sessions@elht.nhs.uk&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=120742"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Across East Lancashire Sites, Across East Lancashire Sites", "postalCode": "BB10 2PQ"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "53.8098", "longitude": "-2.22817"}}, "title": "Rotational Midwife", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916258887", "validThrough": "2020-11-20T23:59:59+0000"}

As a Support Worker, you&#39;ll make a real difference to individual&#39;s lives as you provide support and advice to help each and every one of our service users achieve their potential. Passionate about people, you&#39;ll enjoy the scope and support to enhance your own life too, as you make this role your own as part of a hard-working and friendly team.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Running services on a not-for-profit basis, we invest every penny back into our care - and our people. So, if you&#39;re ambitious and focused on helping people with substance misuse issues, progress a Support Worker role with real value.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Role Responsibility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As one of our Support Workers, you&#39;ll be 100% committed to making sure that people with substance misuse problems have the best start at the very outset of their journey to independent living. This would be a front line role providing advice or signposting to individuals contacting the service either face to face or via phone, liaising with team members and other external partners to support individuals in their Recovery journey.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Hours are Monday to Friday 9am-5pm, with approximately one late shift per monthly rota.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Ideal Candidate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You&#39;ll need a good working knowledge of issues related to substance misuse, as well as a genuine passion for the field. Although previous relevant experience, on either a voluntary basis or as a paid employee is preferable, most important is that you&#39;re flexible, patient and able to view situations from a service user&#39;s perspective. As you&#39;d expect, good moral values will be key. Situations can sometimes be difficult and challenging, so you&#39;ll need to be non-judgemental, with a sensitive approach and a good understanding of how to meet complex needs related to substance misuse.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At a practical level, you&#39;ll need good IT and communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About us&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why Turning Point?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a leading health and social care provider with more than 300 locations across England, we take real pride in the services we offer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Across the varied regions, sectors and settings we operate within, our organisation is held together by a shared vision \u2013 and our people are connected by the same values.

It is an all age service. The service will be delivered by three teams in Wirral, Chester and Congleton. We are offering an opportunity for 3 mental health practitioners to join each team who have a passion and enthusiasm to develop and to work in partnership with other senior clinicians to lead these teams.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You will have demonstrable post registration experience and have the ability to assess risk and make decisions autonomously as well as work as part of a multi-disciplinary team over a 24 hours on a 7 day a week rota.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In return we will provide the necessary support, training and supervision to ensure your development within your role.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Successful applicants will be located within one team.

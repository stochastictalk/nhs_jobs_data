This includes gaining background history and using clinical knowledge to understand whether the person may be suffering from co-morbid mental health problems. I also contact service user\u2019s family in order to gain developmental history. I also attend formulation meetings to share my findings and discuss diagnosis with the wider team. I am also regularly involved in triage of referrals and am able to give my opinion on whether the referral is sufficient and details symptoms of ADHD, in order to offer an assessment. I have regular supervision with my manager and clinical lead. The things that I like about the role are that the team are very approachable and always happy to help, despite current restrictions. I like that I am trusted to work with my own diary, in order to complete tasks. I feel a valued member of the team and always know there is someone there, if need be. I enjoy getting to find out about people&#39;s lives and to then move them on through the treatment pathway.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For further details / informal visits contact:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Name: Paul Wilson&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Job title: Team Manager&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Email address: paul.wilson@cntw.nhs.uk&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Telephone number: 0191 287 6250&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/121049.jpg", "name": "Cumbria, Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS Foundation Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=121049"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Keegan Court, Gateshead", "postalCode": "NE10 8DX"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "54.9399", "longitude": "-1.54147"}}, "title": "Community Practitioner", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916260193", "validThrough": "2020-11-20T23:59:59+0000"}

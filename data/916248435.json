These are clinical areas where there is an increased risk of exposure to infections, including but not limited to COVID19.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A&amp;E provides care for those in the community / care homes with life-threatening emergencies, as well as minor injuries.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Urgent Treatment Centre provides fast medical treatment and advice for patients which are urgent but do not require a visit to A&amp;E. They can also be used when you are unable to wait for an appointment with your GP.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;SDEC is the provision of same day care for emergency patients who would otherwise be admitted to hospital. When a patient comes to hospital, an SDEC service means patients with various medical concerns can be assessed, diagnosed, treated and safely discharged home the same day, rather than being admitted. Some of these patients may need to be admitted or return the next day for further treatment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The division has recently expanded its remit to include further acute assessment wards / areas.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We have a vacancy for a Band 3 Acute &amp; Emergency Care Administrator. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Units comprise of Consultants working alongside Advanced Clinical Practitioners, Junior Doctors, Nurses, Emergency Department Technicians, Clinical Support Workers, and Administrative Staff.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All areas of Acute &amp; Emergency Care are currently 7 days per week, 24 hours a day.

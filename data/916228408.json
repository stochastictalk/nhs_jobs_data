Something our local community and hospital staff can be proud of.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Fundraising Officer will be a key appointment for our future development, and will work as part of a small charity team to deliver high quality, professional fundraising and donor stewardship across a range of channels.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This will include researching and writing applications to charitable trusts and foundations, developing and managing new and existing corporate relationships, managing relationships with individual donors and community groups and playing an important role in communicating about the charity to a range of audiences, online and offline. As part of a small charity team, the role is varied and requires an organised and self-motivated individual with broad fundraising and communications skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The role would suit either an experienced fundraiser with proven skills in the areas above, or someone with demonstrable transferable skills from another sector.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are looking for someone with excellent written and in person communication skills, and a clear thinking, self-motivated and organised approach.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is an opportunity to play a valuable role in helping the NHS go above and beyond for patients and staff, at this unprecedented time, while being a key part of an ambitious and fast moving charity.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For further details / informal visits contact:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Andrew Bickerdike&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Fundraising Manager&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;andrew.bickerdike@nhs.net&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;07966235171&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Surrey and Sussex  Healthcare NHS Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=120733"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Redhill", "postalCode": "RH1 5RH"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "51.2186", "longitude": "-.161262"}}, "title": "Fundraising Officer - band 5", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916228408", "validThrough": "2020-11-09T23:59:59+0000"}

We use language line regularly and allow extra time for those consultations. Honestly the work is busy and challenging but we have an amazing team who fully acknowledge this by regularly reviewing workload, being open to new ways of working and listening to feedback from any member of staff who would like to contribute.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Most of our Partners started here as salaried GPs and we hope to continue this tradition. Despite the challenges of General Practice we all still love working here many years later and a lot of this is based on our stable and long term exceptional team. WE ARE HAPPY TO WAIT FOR THE RIGHT CANDIDATES&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT DO WE HAVE TO OFFER?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00b7 Newport has much to offer as a City itself \u2013 oven overlooked \u2013 but is also within reach of Cardiff, Bristol (no Toll charge!), Beaches, Mountains, Walks, Parks (recommend Park Run to start the weekend off just right) and diverse history and cultural offerings&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00b7 Competitive and negotiable salaries \u2013 and we mean negotiable \u2013 salaries can vary according to what type of sessions you want to do, experience, previous employment and how much or little you want to be involved (we have space for all)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00b7 The usual 6 weeks annual leave, 1 week of study leave apply and we have a meeting every Monday lunchtime (food provided) from which a new gem never fails to emerge! It\u2019s how we all stay sane (debateable) and up to date and all contributions are welcome&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00b7 Varying working patterns on negotiation. We try hard to accommodate days wanted, session start and finish times (child friendly/letting out the dog/cat friendly) and fairness is key.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00b7 The aim of moving towards 15 minute appointments. We all set our own templates to accommodate individual styles of consultation (some power on through and some prefer regular breaks)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00b7 There are no extras and NO HOME VISITS EVER \u2013 these are done in an allocated daily shift that you do not have to rota into&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00b7 Our aim is that our Doctors leave on time! \u2013 this is encouraged and reviewed regularly. Some GPs like to have a home laptop and some run far from this! We can accommodate your viewpoint&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00b7 Optional locum sessions can be undertaken&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WORKLOAD SOLUTIONS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We have:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00b7 Nurse triage&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00b7 Minor illness, chronic disease, ANP and treatment room nurses&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00b7 Prescribing pharmacists&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00b7 An allocated visiting Dr every day and you do not need to opt into this&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00b7 A Duty Doctor daily \u2013 this is fairly distributed and some do more because they just like the session (bizarre but true!) \u2013 again we try to look at session preference as far as possible within the confines of having to cover everything we have to cover&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00b7 A Mental Health Nurse who sees acute patients and follow ups&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00b7 Newly recruited a Learning Disabilities Nurse&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPTIONS FOR GPs GOING FORWARD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Other interests are actively encouraged \u2013 we have a wide range that include:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00b7 Teaching (close connections with Cardiff University) \u2013 Registrars/Medical Students&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00b7 Training (become a trainer!)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00b7 Occupational Health&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00b7 Minor Ops (inject joints for a session!)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00b7 Womens\u2019 Health&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00b7 Diabetes&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00b7 Respiratory&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00b7 Mental Health&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00b7 Dermatology&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00b7 Group Consultations&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The list goes on!

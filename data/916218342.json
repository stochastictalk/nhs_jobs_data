This is in keeping with the \u2018&lt;em&gt;Valuing People Now&lt;/em&gt;\u2019 document, which expects specialist teams to be available to support those who are able to access mainstream services and also provide direct care for those whose needs are complex and cannot be met by mainstream services.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There are currently seven MHLD teams in KMPT, and each team has consultant psychiatrist input and input from a speciality doctor, and/or a CT doctor, and/or a foundation year doctor. Clinical psychologists, trainee psychologists, and MHLD nurse(s) support each of the MHLD localities.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Trust\u2019s policy on inpatient beds for people with a learning disability has been in line with the Winterbourne View action plan. MHLD will be expected to work closely with its partners, Kent County Council and Kent Community Health Foundation Trust, to ensure people with a learning disability are supported to prevent admissions and where this happens, to make sure outcomes to achieve the aim of the admission are agreed with private providers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Successful applicants must have MRCP or equivalent and be on, or within six months of inclusion on, the Specialist Register and be fully registered with the GMC, as well as Approved Clinician and S12 approval under the Mental Health Act.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a 10 PA plus 0.5 PA and 3% Category A availability supplement for on-call post.

They are one of the largest organisations in East Sussex with an annual income of \u00a3476 million. Their extensive health services are provided by over 7000 dedicated members of staff working from two acute hospitals in Hastings and Eastbourne, three community hospitals in Bexhill, Rye and Uckfield, over 100 community sites across East Sussex and in people\u2019s own homes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In November and December 2019 the Care Quality Commission (CQC), the health and care services regulator, undertook their latest inspection of the quality of care and services at the Trust. The results, which were published in February, rated the Trust \u2018Good\u2019 overall, \u2018Outstanding\u2019 for Caring and \u2018Outstanding\u2019 for Effective. Against the backdrop of increased demand they have continued to build on the financial improvements they made last year by improving the quality, efficiency and effectiveness of the care they provide. As a result they exceeded their financial plan and these improvements led to them coming out of Special Measures for Finance in July 2019 and earned an additional FRF payment at year end to bring their final outturn to a small surplus of \u00a350k.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s an exciting time to join the Trust as they plan for the \u00a3500m investment that has been committed to ESHT over the next decade, through their \u2018Building for the Future\u2019 programme. These extensive plans over the next decade will leave no part of the Trusts hospital infrastructure left untouched. They are aiming to provide a new hospital at Eastbourne; new medical wards and refurbishment at Conquest and a new clinical building at Bexhill.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Responsible to the Chief Finance Officer , the Deputy Director of Finance will have overall strategic leadership and performance management of the Finance and Procurement Directorate, ensuring department systems and processes are fit for purpose and staff are trained and equipped to ensure delivery of statutory financial duties.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a Senior Member of the Finance leadership team, delivery against the Trust\u2019s corporate objectives is paramount.

Would you like to further your skills by working autonomously, providing rapid assessment of complex patients to our partner organisations? If so we would love to hear from you!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are transforming clinical care to care homes across Hampshire and the Isle of Wight with our new service Telemedicine.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The aim of the Telemedicine is to provide remote clinical care to support residents in their care home. The service will be starting with a phased approach and will gradually increase the number of homes it supports.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is an innovative clinical project and the post-holders will be required to actively engage with hospital staff, community teams and key stakeholders as well as care homes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You will carry out a complete virtual and holistic assessment of the patient by utilising the available technology, as well as capturing data and outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Every member of the team will help us shape our service and achieve successful implementation along with long term sustainability; it really is an exciting time to join us.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Telemedicine project has been supported by NHS digital funding and you will be working within an enthusiastic team with a desire to improve patient outcomes and establish a successful STP wide service improvement.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This post is offered as a fixed term or secondment with a view to becoming substantive at the end of the pilot process.

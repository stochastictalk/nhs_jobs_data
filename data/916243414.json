This change does not affect our ability to recruit and should you be employed at the end of June 2021 you will transfer to the new provider on the same terms and conditions \u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Working for ACE puts you right at the heart of all North Essex has to offer. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Within Tendring you have 60kms of beautiful coastline including Blue Flag beaches, the gentile charm of Frinton and the more bustling Clacton \u2013 one of the driest places to live in the UK! \u00a0Within a stone\u2019s throw of Tendring is Colchester \u2013 Britain\u2019s oldest recorded town and now one of its fastest growing with a range of recreational facilities to match. The jewel in the crown of its historic past is its Norman castle, built on Roman foundations. A wealth of new homes is complemented by an equally broad selection of character homes in the plethora of picture-postcards villages that surround the town. The likes of Sible Hedingham, Finchingfield and Dedham (the latter being the heart of Constable Country made famous by the artist John Constable) are much sought-after locations. In addition North Essex boasts several nationally acclaimed schools, including Colchester Royal Grammar School and Colchester County High School for Girls. London Stansted Airport is less than an hour\u2019s drive away while all the attractions of London itself are within easy reach. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Anglian Community Enterprise (CIC)", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=125574"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Colchester/Tendring", "postalCode": "CO15 4AB"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "51.8041", "longitude": "1.16672"}}, "title": "Tissue Viability Associate Practitioner, Band 4", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916243414", "validThrough": "2020-11-09T23:59:59+0000"}

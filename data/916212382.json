Here are some of the reasons we\u2019re unique\u2026&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Located in the grounds of Weston General Hospital, we are a nurse-led unit, supported by a visiting consultant nephrologist, offering holistic care to patients with multiple complex needs that require haemodialysis or on-line haemodiafiltration treatment.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We are part of the Richard Bright Renal Unit, a regional renal transplant centre with six haemodialysis Satellite Units across the South West. Our Trust is a centre of excellence for the delivery of care for people with renal impairment and our unit is proud to participate in pioneering clinical trials, including H4RT and the BISTRO Trial.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We support our patients to work jointly with staff in decision making on their treatment and active involvement in the treatment procedure through shared and self-care programs.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We provide comprehensive support offering 6 weeks supernumerary time with an allocated mentor, providing personalised training to new starters in our team.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We are also passionate about professional development. Within our Individual Performance Reviews, our nurses can share their personal career aspirations with the senior team and discuss opportunities available for additional training, including external specialist renal courses and internal management training hosted by the Learning and Development team at our Southmead site.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We are able to offer our nurses a range of shift patterns, including earlies, lates and long days which allow for a good work life balance. Our department is open Monday to Saturday, 6.30am-7pm so our nurses receive every Sunday off duty. We are also closed Christmas day and New Year\u2019s Day.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But it\u2019s not just our Ambleside Satellite unit which is impressive; our trust itself is pioneering, progressive and proud. Let us tell you a little more about it\u2026&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We\u2019re committed to supporting staff on their career journey with us offering personalised training packages and bespoke specialty rotations. We also support internal transfers for those who wish to gain experience in a new specialty or further develop their skills.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Our nurses don\u2019t shy away from a challenge in aid of Southmead Hospital Charity. They cycle, run, row and race in aid of a fantastic cause, or sing in our staff choir and compete in \u2018Southmead Does Strictly\u2019.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Our staff are consulted on equity issues across the trust within equality and development groups, and given the mentoring and support to succeed. Our trust supports the development of Bristol\u2019s LGBT+ manifesto and a case study of good practice has been reported to NHS England in response to a government review of public services and Trans people.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right, that\u2019s enough about us\u2026 let\u2019s focus on you.

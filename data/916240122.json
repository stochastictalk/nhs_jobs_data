At step 3 we offer individual and group CBT, Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy, Interpersonal Therapy, Couples Therapy for Depression, Counselling for Depression and EMDR.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Wellbeing Suffolk is expanding, and we are beginning to work with people living with Long Term Conditions (physical health problems). We will offer evidence based psychological treatments to help individuals to live well with their condition and strengthen links with key physical health colleagues in our area.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We want patients and staff to recommend our organisation as a place where they would be happy for their friends and family to be treated. You can help us do this by bringing your skills, experience and commitment to Wellbeing Suffolk. We are a strongly clinically led service and the development of our staff is important to us. You will receive regular supervision as well as in service training and CPD days that ensure your continued learning and development. We are a research-friendly service currently involved in a number of projects focusing on improving outcomes for our service users, and ways of improving the support offered to therapists to improve therapeutic skills. We are also passionate about technology, utilising virtual reality and other innovations where these aid therapy and improve the experience for our service users.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You must hold a BABCP recognised core profession or prepare a KSA entry route portfolio prior to interview. Psychological Wellbeing Practitioners should have a minimum of two years post qualification experience in line with national IAPT guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Applications from some core professions from a physical health background with experience of working with mental health conditions can also be considered.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If you are invited to an interview, you must bring with you any academic qualifications, certificates and evidence you hold, as applicable. Offers cannot be made without this information.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If you do not have a BABCP recognised core profession you must follow the KSA procedure and prepare your portfolio prior to the interview. You will need to bring this to the interview and may be asked to submit this a least one week prior to your interview if you are shortlisted. The KSA will be scrutinised by the course KSA lead who may ask you further questions about your portfolio at interview and if you are successful they will give you feedback on which areas require further work to be completed by the end to the training. You will submit your portfolio again during the course to be marked after undertaking the required actions.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There will be a learning agreement in place between the trainee and the employer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The trainee CBT position includes undertaking the PG Diploma in High Intensity CBT at the University of East Anglia.

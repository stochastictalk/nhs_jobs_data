He\u2019s only just come out and he got another infection when he was there. We have got one carer once a day and they couldn\u2019t get him to stand up on Thursday night. By Friday he had been stuck in his chair all night as he was too tired and weak to get up, the Home First Therapists came in and helped. They were so kind; they got him out of the chair and into bed. They made him feel comfortable; they treated him like he was special and not just a number, they made me feel better to\u201d &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Do you have the ability to deliver similar high quality compassionate care and think you will be the right person to join our team which is already proven to make a difference? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We are looking for a Band 6 Physiotherapists to provide an effective and efficient therapy service.

Many of these clinics are Consultant led in addition to having ESP clinicians and specialist nurses running clinics. We work closely with Physiotherapy, Occupational therapy and Radiology all of which are located within the department, and we also have a registered nurse led treatment room for wound care review and pre - assessment health checks to be completed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Health promotion is asignificant part of the work that we do and the successful applicant will be expected after appropriatetraining has been completed, to ensure that up to date relevant health promotion and information is provided to the patients attending clinics. The successful applicant will also be expected to act as a chaperone to patients being examined in clinic -maintaining appropriate levels of privacy and dignity, and to perform basic healthcare screeningfor those patients who are listed for either Day case or inpatient surgery.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Ideally the applicant will have completed all relevant MYCARE training and be able to navigate the system efficiently. Additional training can be provided to applicants who have completed ward based MYCARE training and will therefore require outpatient specific education.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As the department has 1.91 WTE available, I am able to offer the following contractual hours to the successful applicants:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;37.5 hours per week (1.0 WTE)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;34 hours per week (0.90 WTE) OR 2 x 16 hour posts within the department.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Please indicate on your application form the amount of hours that you would be interested in working from the above choices.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The department is open Monday - Friday. The shift pattern will vary depending on the needs of the department and in order to ensure that patient safety is upheld we have a system of allocating staff to stay until the afternoon clinics are completed and the department can be closed. The expectation is that the successful applicant will be part of the above process. Although the majority of the clinics are held at the Wonford site we also cover Spinal services at Heavitree Hospital and therefore the successful applicant will be expected to work between both sites.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our vision is to provide safe, high quality seamless services delivered with courtesy and respect. To achieve our vision we expect all our staff to uphold our Trust values. Our Trust values are: &lt;br /&gt; Honesty, Openness &amp; Integrity&lt;br /&gt; Fairness&lt;br /&gt; Inclusion &amp; Collaboration&lt;br /&gt; Respect &amp; Dignity&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;***Preference will be given to staff with \u2018Priority\u2019 and &#39;At Risk&#39; status including NHS At Risk staff throughout Devon.***&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;DUE TO THE ANTICIPATED HIGH NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS FOR THIS POST WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO CLOSE THE VACANCY BEFORE THE CLOSING DATE.&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/121044.jpg", "name": "Royal Devon and Exeter NHS Foundation Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=121044"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Exeter", "postalCode": "EX2 5DW"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "50.7167", "longitude": "-3.50669"}}, "title": "HCA PEOC OPD", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916244342", "validThrough": "2020-11-11T23:59:59+0000"}

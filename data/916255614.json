Collectively, the two hospitals have 1,440 beds, revenue budget of over \u00a3500m and approximately 10,000 staff. Moving to a group model but retaining the existing boards, will enable KGH and NGH to integrate their clinical services whilst developing innovate approaches to streamlining pathways, with a clear focus on doing the right thing for patients every time. Working together, they will also design more effective ways in which corporate support services are provided, including the establishment of a new shared corporate services hub that will harmonise processes across the two organisations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Group has ambitious to become a university hospitals group and with major capital investment approved by the Secretary of State is now planning to reshape the estate to rival many of the most modern acute care facilities at a scale that will attract the best available talent in the market. With a number of Group roles now in place, including the Group Chief Executive Officer, we are now seeking to appoint two Hospital Chief Executive Officers (HCEO) to lead each of the two sites.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The key responsibility of the HCEO role is to ensure each Trust meets its statutory, regulatory and governance obligations, providing services that continuously improve patient care, patient safety and the overall patient experience whilst contributing strategically to the development of the group to ensure it has the capacity, capability, leadership and culture to deliver outstanding performance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We need kind, compassionate and inclusive leaders for our two hospital sites who will both make great things happen in each Trust and bring people together and with them on our ambitious group journey. This will require individuals with substantial experience in an acute environment, a track record at Board level of achieving sustained service change and improvement, experience of building effective and productive working relationships with a wide range of people and partners and a collaborative management style.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For further details / informal visits contact:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nick Cole E &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nick.Cole@Veredus.co.uk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; M 07736 491804 or Neal Mankey E &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neil.Mankey@Veredus.co.uk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; M 07541 644162&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Closing date: 12 noon on 20th November&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interviews to be held: 14th December&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/120843.png", "name": "Kettering General Hospital NHS Foundation Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=120843"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Kettering General Hospital, Kettering", "postalCode": "NN16 8UZ"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "52.4028", "longitude": "-.741278"}}, "title": "Hospital Chief Executive Officer (HCEO)", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916255614", "validThrough": "2020-11-20T23:59:59+0000"}

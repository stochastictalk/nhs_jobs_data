This support will enable more people to remain at home or close to home, reducing the need for hospital admission. It aims to supports people with dementia to be supported in a familiar environment, reducing the anxiety and distress that can be associated with transfer to an unfamiliar care environment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;D-HTT will provide a rapid health response across seven days to patients whose presentation indicates that they are at risk of immediate deterioration or relapse that could escalate to an in-patient admission; or have been recently discharged from the Specialist Dementia Inpatient Pathway.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are looking for highly motivated and enthusiastic individuals at Band 6 and Band 5 level initially (registered nurses, AHP\u2019s etc.) to join our dynamic team to support this new community based service. The D-HTT will be an integral part of the Dementia Care Pathway across the county and rotational posts may be considered if preferred with flexible working.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The ideal candidate will need to demonstrate an understanding of the complexities and challenges that can present for patients with dementia and for their carers. You will have patience, excellent communication skills, creativity, empathy and positivity to ensure that positive engagement can take place. You will need to demonstrate an ability to adapt to change, be part of innovative practice and have a true desire to rise to a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You will be joining a new fast-paced service providing intensive home treatment and delivering evidenced based interventions that provide safe and supportive care.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The posts will include weekend working to enable flexibility in meeting the needs of service users and their carers. The service is county wide with bases located at Lincoln and Boston and due to the nature of the role it is essential that applicants are able to travel effectively and independently on a daily basis around the County.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a great development opportunity for the right candidate. Full time positions are preferred, but part time would be considered. A full induction package will be offered, access to training, regular supervision, annual appraisal and a commitment to developing staff to their full potential.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For further information please contact Deborah Blant, Service manager on 07771 378293 or e-mail d.blant@nhs.net&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/120663.jpg", "name": "Lincolnshire Partnership NHS Foundation Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=120663"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Lincoln", "postalCode": "LN6 8UZ"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "53.1854", "longitude": "-.575247"}}, "title": "Acute Care Nurse", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916248291", "validThrough": "2020-11-12T23:59:59+0000"}

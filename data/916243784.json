Assessments and treatments are carried out in clinic, the child\u2019s home, via telephone or video technology or in education setting. We offer a range of individual or group treatments. The service uses Care Aims which is a caseload management and clinical decision making tool to help support clinical decisions, outcome measures and caseloads.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Communication, organisational and time management skills are essential and you will need to be able to develop working relationships with the child, their families and other staff working alongside them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You will receive regular supervision and have access to the service\u2019s in-house CPD program and journal clubs.

It is a new opportunity to join a small established team who offer a service to children and young people who have engaged in harmful sexual behaviours. The post holder undertakes specialist assessments, interventions and consultations for which training and regular supervision is provided and there is also the opportunity to do joint work with experienced clinicians. There is close interagency working and the specialist also sits within a broader multi- disciplinary team at our CAMHS base.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Ideally the candidate will have experience in delivering services to young people but specialist skills with adults may be transferable if the candidate can explain in their application their aptitude for this. Likewise, we would ideally seek someone who has some professional experience within harmful sexual behaviour but we would consider applicants who can demonstrate experience in closely allied specialisms and the capacity to learn the needed skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Key skills and ideal experience for the role are:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience of working professionally with children of all ages and their families/ carers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;An understanding of child development and the factors that impact on HSB&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Knowledge of evidence-based assessment and intervention models for children and young people with sexually harmful behaviour&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Knowledge of risks and protective factors in relations to HSB&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;An ability to manage hearing and communicating sensitive and sometimes distressing information with children, families and professional networks&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Confidence in delivering consultation, training and advice to multi-agency staff&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Work well in a small, multi-professional team and be able to work independently across the county&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have the ability to think flexibly and respond to the unique demands of many different situations, cultures and contexts&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have expertise in assessing and acting upon risk, protective and resilience factors and developmental issues that have to be considered.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Be able to work in partnership with professionals from a range of agencies to safeguard children.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have skills and confidence to contribute to CYPS service wide clinical tasks. This currently amounts to about 6 hours a month spent on tasks such as self harm follow up appointments and a duty type role. Full induction and training are given.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is not an exhaustive list and we would welcome any interested applicant phoning us to discuss the role in more detail. This role holds a generic CAMHS job description, however specialist skills and responsibilities related to this work role will be clearly reflected within a personalised job plan.

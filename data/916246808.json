Attempts will be made to try and achieve as many aspects of these goals as is possible however the candidate is advised that this may change dependant on the degree of Covid work.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Clinical Experience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Consolidation of clinical skills and experience in general anaesthetic practice.

During the most recent surge phase, trainee grade doctors have worked in teams of five to fulfil sufficient work force requirement and also rest periods in between. This is supported extensively with resident consultant presence. It is envisaged that in the first instance, the 1; 8 shift pattern will be applied with a view of moving to a different Covid rota if activity in ICU dictates the need. In view of this, prior experience in ICU will be favourable.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Please contact the Anaesthetic Department to speak to Dr Tote, Deputy Chief of Service Anaesthesia/ICU via the anaesthetic administration office 01276 604161&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For further details / informal visits contact:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Name: Subodh Tote&lt;br /&gt;Job title: Deputy Chief of Service Anaesthesia/ICU&lt;br /&gt;Telephone number: 01276 604161&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/121099.png", "name": "Frimley Health NHS Foundation Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=121099"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Frimley Park Hospital, Frimley", "postalCode": "GU16 7UJ"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "51.3197", "longitude": "-.741538"}}, "title": "Trust doctor in Anaesthetics", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916246808", "validThrough": "2020-11-18T23:59:59+0000"}

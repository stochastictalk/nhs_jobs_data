The ward also takes acute orthopaedic trauma from the larger sites of SGH and DPOW. The aim on transfer is to rehabilitate the patient and to safely discharge them back to the community.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We also house our own pre assessment service along with orthopaedic clinics.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Ward 6 has been tasked with providing the additional service of a HOBS bay. This will accommodate patients that we class as a higher anaesthetic grade patient that historically would be admitted at the larger acute sites of Scunthorpe and Grimsby.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The HOB will operate on a staffing level of 1+1 and the registered nurse will be expected to provide direct patient care. They will take the lead of the patient care directly associated to patients in the HOB. This will include conducting ward rounds and being part of the decision making process to step the patient back down to the general ward area.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The candidate will be supported by colleagues and ward sisters within this role and will be part of a small friendly team.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is an exciting opportunity to gain skills in working in acute care of the surgical patient. All applicants should demonstrate a keen interest in care of the surgical patient and previous experience would be extremely desirable although not essential.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The applicant may also be expected to rotate into the other surgical areas including the inpatient area of ward 6 and potentially day surgery (Ward 7). Cross cover for the area is essential and the post will be rotational across a 7 day service working nights days and weekends.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are looking for highly enthusiastic motivated candidates that are passionate about surgery and are keen to support this new service.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For further details / informal visits contact:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Katie White, Ward Manager&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;katie.white35@nhs.net&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;03033 304114&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Sophie Hutchinson, Deputy Ward Manager&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;03033 304114&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/121065.png", "name": "Northern Lincolnshire and Goole NHS Foundation Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=121065"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Goole", "postalCode": "DN14 6RX"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "53.7154", "longitude": "-.874498"}}, "title": "Staff Nurse - Ward 6 - Goole", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916250452", "validThrough": "2020-11-15T23:59:59+0000"}

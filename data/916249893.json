You will be allocated a shift pattern that suits your own personal preferences. Whether that is all shifts, nights only or days only we will be able to accommodate all preferences and set your individual Rota to suit.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There are currently vacancies in the team at Band 5 Staff nurse level. Who will work to fill shift vacancies throughout the trust. The big difference to anywhere else is that you will not be assigned to a ward. You will be working with the same flexibility as a bank or agency nurse but with all the perks of a substantive nurse. Yet you will have the luxury of a set rota for a 4 \u2013 6-week period. (You can plan your life).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After 9 months you will also have the option to become permanently ward based (subject to availability) should you wish to. This process will be managed by Matron White and be completely stress free.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In addition, the Trust offers secure guaranteed car parking for all shifts patterns.&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/121484.png", "name": "The Rotherham NHS Foundation Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=121484"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Rotherham", "postalCode": "S60 2UD"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "53.4144", "longitude": "-1.34257"}}, "title": "Staff Nurse", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916249893", "validThrough": "2020-11-26T23:59:59+0000"}

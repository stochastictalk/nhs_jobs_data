Life would never be the same and I really believed that I would not make it. My OT showed me that things were possible and that although life would be very different, it was still worth living. With her help to use a wheelchair and get in and out of bed I began to feel independent again. Now I can see a future, albeit from a wheelchair. Because of the knowledge I was given I can move on and consider myself able-disabled, not just disabled.\u201d&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; Simon (Patient with Spinal Cord Injury)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If the above words inspire you we\u2019d love to meet you.

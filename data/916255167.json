I couldn\u2019t have wished for a more supportive team to start out my journey as an NQP with and have been really impressed with the way the team has adapted so well to working a bit differently this term. There has been a wealth of resources and guidance available to me throughout which have helped to make my transition from student to NQP that bit easier.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cI started working for this trust in September, from the first day the whole team have been friendly, welcoming and supportive, particularly through the changes due to COVID-19. The communication within the trust is fantastic. So far, the mentor programme has been great and I\u2019ve had lots of shadowing experience. I would highly recommend working for this trust.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our team is friendly and kind; we meet regularly and encourage innovation and service improvement.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Suffolk is a lovely place to live with beaches and a variety of sporting and cultural activities to be enjoyed!

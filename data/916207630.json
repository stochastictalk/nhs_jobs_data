Here are some of the reasons we\u2019re unique\u2026.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Our unit is proud to have achieved JAG accreditation and runs a busy service from four dedicated procedure rooms, across a range of cases including Capsule Endoscopy, Enteroscopy, Bowel Screening, GI Endoscopy and GI pre-assessment clinics.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We are passionate about staff development, running dedicated training sessions once a week for all nursing staff to come together to develop their skills. For those who already have experience in Endoscopy, we would encourage a conversation with the senior team within the unit to discuss how we can best support your career aspirations.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Our unit undertakes over 11,000 endoscopies each year and our lists usually run between 8am \u2013 6.30pm, Monday \u2013 Saturday. We do not currently run night shifts but we have 2 evening shifts until 8.30pm per week&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But it\u2019s not just our Endoscopy department which is impressive; our trust itself is pioneering, progressive and proud. Let us tell you a little more about it\u2026..&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Our health and wellbeing initiatives, devised by our dedicated staff wellbeing team, encompass lifestyle support, physical support and psychological support, and have been nationally recognised by REBA.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We value staff feedback; in the results of our 2019 staff survey, our response rate was &lt;strong&gt;higher than the national average &lt;/strong&gt;and highlighted we had improved in all the areas staff told us were priorities in 2018. Out of the 90 questions asked, we had made 73 improvements from the previous year and 69% of staff would recommend our organisation as a place to work (6% better than the national average).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Our nurses do not shy away from a challenge in aid of Southmead Hospital Charity. They cycle, run, row and race in aid of a fantastic cause, or sing in our staff choir and compete in \u2018Southmead Does Strictly\u2019.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We\u2019re committed to supporting staff on their career journey with us offering personalised training packages and bespoke specialty rotations. We also support internal transfers for those who wish to gain experience in a new specialty or further develop their skills.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Our staff are consulted on equity issues across the trust within equality and development groups, and are given the mentoring and support to succeed. Our trust supports the development of Bristol\u2019s LGBT+ manifesto and a case study of good practice has been reported to NHS England in response to a government review of public services and Trans people.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Our clinical environment is award-winning in its approach to healthcare design; each patient room has a view, many of which are naturally ventilated and 75% of rooms in our Brunel Building are single and en-suite. With nurses in mind, our clinical spine carefully separates staff and patient areas, with a generous staff canteen extending out to a rooftop terrace.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bristol is consistently voted the best place to live in the UK, with vibrant local music, arts and gastronomic scenes.

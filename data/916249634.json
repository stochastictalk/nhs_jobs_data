By working within a competency framework over a 2 year period Derbyshire Healthcare aims to offer a training and development programme for all band 5 nursing staff.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does it work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When a nursing staff member completes the competency package they will be automatically transferred into a band 6 Clinical role without interview. This will be determined by the completion of the competency framework and an ability to show a senior level of clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are we doing this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;By doing so, we aim to make acute inpatient care a specialist area to work in with the highest level of experienced and trained staff, improving the working environment and the patient experience and clinical care they receive.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What\u2019s the offer and support?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Alongside the development programme, each staff member will receive regular clinical supervision, managerial supervision, practice development group engagement and opportunities for coaching and mentoring improving the access to ongoing career development and planning. All development programmes will be managed by the local line manager with oversight from the Area Service Manager, Head of Nursing and Clinical Matron.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What\u2019s the goal?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;By engaging in the programme you will have opportunities to work, learn and shadow a variety of healthcare professionals across Derbyshire Healthcare and to lead and take part in quality improvement projects, and we will provide better care.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For further details / informal visits contact:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Senior Nurse, Kerby Walker, kerby.walker@nhs.net&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Lead Nurse, Hollie Grief, h.grief@nhs.net&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;01332 623867&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/121834.jpg", "name": "Derbyshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=121834"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Radbourne Unit - University Hospitals of Derby Site, Derby", "postalCode": "DE22 3WQ"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "52.9126", "longitude": "-1.51002"}}, "title": "Registered Nurse", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916249634", "validThrough": "2020-11-22T23:59:59+0000"}

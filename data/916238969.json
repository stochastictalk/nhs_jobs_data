RDC\u2019s have also been adopted by NHS England as a key part of earlier diagnosis of cancer and other serious conditions and rolled out nationally as part of the long term plan with an aim of all 75% of cancers being diagnosed at stage 1 or 2 by 2028.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;At GSTT we offer patients a holistic, systematic review of their symptoms with a view to an established diagnosis before onward secondary care referral or discharge to primary care. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is an innovative and rapidly expanding service available across all South East London Clinical Commissioning Groups, covering all patients 18 years and over.

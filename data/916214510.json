The latest national inpatient survey puts us in the top 20% of hospitals with high standards for safety and privacy and dignity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An exciting opportunity has arisen for Registered Nurses to join our friendly nursing team within Intensive Care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have spacious, well equipped units with dedicated teams of Intensivists, experienced critical care nurses and proactive AHP&#39;s. The unit is dynamic and forward thinking; embracing new initiatives, change and the development of services.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You would be caring for critically ill patients requiring multi organ support; responsible for assessing, planning and delivering a high standard of individualised nursing care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will receive orientation to the unit and will be comprehensively supported with a full induction programme and ongoing development in the care of the critically ill patient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You must have a minimum of 12 months demonstrable post registration experience; and current acute setting experience is essential. Previous critical care experience is desirable but not essential. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ability to work internal rotation to night duty is essential.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Due to COVID-19 and the Governments guidance on social distancing your interview may be carried out via Microsoft Teams.

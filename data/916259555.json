Feedback within the system is really positive, particularly the impact this is having on patient flow, access to services for our primary care colleagues and partnership working between organisations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To support the work of the West CCC we have new vacancies for administrators. This is a really exciting opportunity to become part of a team which will continue to be at the centre of our locality-based services and a chance to contribute to our ongoing response and recovery to Covid-19.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The West CCC (08.00 to 20.00 service 7 days per week) accommodates an operational team that integrates health, social and voluntary sector care to coordinate the triage of local demand and capacity to ensure the highest needs are prioritised and addressed with the most appropriate available resources from the multi-disciplinary and cross organisational team, therefore flexibility and availability will be essential across these days and times.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The West CCC Team is staffed by a range of people including health, social care and voluntary sector workers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The West CCC team will focuses on developing the service through:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prioritisation:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Locality based decision-making enables effective prioritisation of care delivery across existing team boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Capacity:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Localising delivery and ensuring effective flexibility of workforce improves efficiency of service delivery&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Communication:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Enhanced communication speed up escalation and add flexibility to response&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Posts: 2&lt;/em&gt; x 37.5 per week hour posts&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;These are fixed term posts until 31.03.2020&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For further details / informal visits contact:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;NameBen MoodyJob titleFloor Manager, West Community Co-ordination CentreEmail addressbenjamin.moody@nhs.netTelephone number01872 326711/07799 477761Additional contact information&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Kate Hare&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Floor Manager and Nurse Prioritiser&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;kate.hare@nhs.net&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;01872 326711&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/120947.png", "name": "Cornwall Partnership NHS Foundation Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=120947"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Council Offices, Camborne", "postalCode": "TR14 8SX"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "50.2156", "longitude": "-5.2868"}}, "title": "Administration Support Worker - Band 3", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916259555", "validThrough": "2020-11-22T23:59:59+0000"}

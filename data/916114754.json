The assessment was made against 20 key findings from the national staff survey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\u2022 ELHT was included in a shortlist of the 100 \u2018Best Places to Work\u2019 compiled by the Health Service Journal and Nursing Times. The Trust was also one of only 42 selected of Acute Trusts nationally recognised by the publications as leading the way as the best place to work. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\u2022 Building on the development of our first dementia friendly ward in 2014 (C5), the dedication of staff on this ward, resulted in them being awarded the prestigious Quality Mark in 2015 based on reviews submitted by patients. Run by the Royal College of Psychiatrists, the Quality Mark was established to encourage hospital wards to become involved in improving the quality of essential care of older people and to recognise good care provision, as identified by patient feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\u2022 Patients in Kendal and surrounding areas are now able to get quicker diagnosis and treatment for any vascular problems from a specialist clinic run by skilled surgeons from East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust on their doorstep.

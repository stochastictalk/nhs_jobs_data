The post holder will support the day to day running of a range of National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) portfolio clinical research studies, principally in COVID research and rheumatology, but other specialties too. They will support the implementation of research protocols and the recruitment of patients into portfolio studies, and any resultant data collection and follow-up requirements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The post involves the recruitment, education and monitoring of trial patients and the collection and documentation of accurate data, including collection and management of tissue or samples. It will involve working collaboratively with the clinical trials team and the wider multi-disciplinary team in the management of a caseload of clinical trial patients. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The successful candidate will need to meet the challenge of working autonomously and within a team, and be self-motivated. The post would be based in Haywood Hospital, Stoke on Trent, but working across site as required; in particular the COVID research will involve regular travel to our research site at Cheadle Hospital, North Staffordshire. As study visits may take place across site and in participants\u2019 homes, the successful candidate will need a full driving license and access to a car.&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Midlands Partnership NHS Foundation Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=121040"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Haywood Hospital", "postalCode": "ST6 7AG"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "53.0571", "longitude": "-2.19003"}}, "title": "Research Nurse", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916206168", "validThrough": "2020-11-13T23:59:59+0000"}

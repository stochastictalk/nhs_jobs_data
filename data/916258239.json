We are looking to promote a current Band 8A physicist to Band 8B. The postholder will take responsibility for equipment quality control and dosimetry in Radiotherapy Physics, will be closely involved with the specification and selection of new radiotherapy equipment and will take the leading role in equipment commissioning. The postholder will also be expected to work closely with the lead physicist for the Swindon GWH satellite unit, in order to ensure consistency in QC and dosimetry procedures.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Oxford Cancer Centre in the Churchill Hospital has six multi-mode Varian linacs, GE CT scanner, Acuity simulator, Aria and Eclipse TPS, under a PFI Managed Equipment Service. Recent implementations include SRS/SRT with ExacTrac imaging, SABR under CtE, breath-hold, HDR brachytherapy, MIRADA auto-contouring and transmission dosimetry. &lt;br /&gt;Planned developments include a linac replacement programme starting in 2020-21, adaptive radiation therapy based on in-treatment imaging, introduction of new treatment planning algorithms and extension of MIRADA auto contouring to more sites. There are close links with the CRUK/MRC Oxford Institute for Radiation Oncology and Biology, and an expanding portfolio of clinical trials&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For informal discussions about this posts please contact Ralph Roberts, Radiotherapy Physics Operational Manager ralph.roberts@ouh.nhs.uk or Jonathan Lane, Head of Radiotherapy Physics jonathan.lane1@ouh.nhs.uk&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Closing Date-13th November 2020&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Planned Interview Date-30th November 2020&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For further details / informal visits contact:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;NameRalph RobertsJob titleRadiotherapy Physics Operational ManagerEmail addressralph.roberts@ouh.nhs.ukTelephone number01865235506&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=120889"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Churchill Hospital, Oxford", "postalCode": "OX3 9DU"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "51.7639", "longitude": "-1.21979"}}, "title": "Principal Radiotherapy Physicist", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916258239", "validThrough": "2020-11-13T23:59:59+0000"}

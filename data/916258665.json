We host 34 Theatres, delivering both elective and emergency surgery, supported by 72 Medirooms.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;An innovative concept in healthcare, our Medirooms combine the traditional recovery, day-case, same day and admission areas into a single patient room environment, specifically designed to enhance patient experience by improving the level of privacy and dignity that these areas were traditionally able to offer. Patients also benefit from continuity of case as they are admitted, recovered and discharged/transferred by the same Mediroom team.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We are based within the award-winning Brunel building at Southmead Hospital. Our state-of-the-art facilities have led us to obtain multiple awards, including the best designed large hospital internationally at the European Healthcare Design Awards.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;But it\u2019s not just our Theatre department which is exciting; our Trust bank, NBTeXtra, is innovative, impressive and inclusive.

If you would like your application to be considered under this scheme you will need to clearly identify this at the end of your supporting information, and include the name, job title and place of work of the member of staff who referred you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you a Registered Nurse \u2013 Adult (RN) who is looking for flexible working arrangements with a supportive, understanding employer? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At Western Sussex Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, we realise that many RN have busy and demanding commitments outside of their working life and are unable to commit to the traditional shift patterns. With this in mind, we are proud to be able to offer a variety of flexible working options and contracts, these include:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fixed Bank (Nurse pool): &lt;/strong&gt;If your availability is for certain shifts on set days, we could offer guaranteed employment to your requirements.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexible Bank: &lt;/strong&gt;The traditional bank agreement where availability is matched to outstanding shifts (across a variety of wards).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fixed-term: &lt;/strong&gt;An extended period with a defined start and end date where security is required. This could include multiple fixed-term posts over the year and could be on one ward or across a variety of wards.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part-time: &lt;/strong&gt;Any hours that are worked that are not considered full-time (typically 37.5 hours/week). There may be a limit in the minimum hours worked to maintain skill and competence in certain areas.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Term-time: &lt;/strong&gt;A permanent contract where paid/unpaid leave can be taken during school holidays or other defined periods.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Job-sharing: &lt;/strong&gt;Covering full-time hours with another member of staff (as an example - you prefer nights \u2013 they prefer days).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Annualised Hours: &lt;/strong&gt;The number of hours worked is fixed over the year, but variation in hours worked per week is available. This could include weeks where zero hours or minimum shift hours can be worked.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexible hours: &lt;/strong&gt;If you are unable to commit to traditional shift times and patterns - we could accommodate later start and/or an earlier finish times.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/121075.png", "name": "Western Sussex Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=121075"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Worthing and St Richards Hospital, Chichester and Worthing", "postalCode": "BN11 2DH"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "50.8167", "longitude": "-.364296"}}, "title": "Staff Nurses - Flexible Working - November - Worthing", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916237430", "validThrough": "2020-11-17T23:59:59+0000"}

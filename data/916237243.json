This is a new consultant post created to ensure service capacity matches demand.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The post holder will contribute to both outpatient and inpatient services at Colchester, providing outpatient clinic capacity and sharing responsibility for ward consultations and inpatient care with the other consultants. An interest in epilepsy, demyelinating disorders, or movement disorders that complements the activities of the existing specialist nurses would be welcome but there are many other opportunities in other areas. The post holder will also contribute to structured medical student teaching. Currently the Neurology department teaches students from the UEA Medical School in three one-month blocks per year and from 2016, with the doubling in size of the University of Cambridge Clinical School, Cambridge students rotate out to Colchester.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Applications for a Locum post will be accepted for those not on the Specialist Register.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Applicants or prospective applicants are encouraged to visit the department and to meet prospective colleagues.

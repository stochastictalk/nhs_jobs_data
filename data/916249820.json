Whilst this is an admirable government initiative, please be aware we are not signed up to this scheme. This is a question on the NHS jobs application form which is outside of our own control. Our own process ensures we consider candidates on the merit of their application only and we do not ask any questions regarding a disability as part of our selection process. We only give candidates the opportunity to share information regarding any disability after candidates are invited to interview and only if the candidate feels they require adjustments in the interview process.&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Priory Medical Group", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=130874"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "York", "postalCode": "YO24 3WX"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "53.9495", "longitude": "-1.12943"}}, "title": "Practice Nurse", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916249820", "validThrough": "2020-12-08T23:59:59+0000"}

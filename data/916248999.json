If so, this is an ideal opportunity for you to join our Home Training Dialysis team at Altrincham Home Training Unit.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Home Training Unit is a 9 bedded dialysis unit which aims to optimise patient involvement in dialysis through a structured training program. The team focus on the individual training needs of each patient and tailor their training to suit the patient&#39;s individual goals. These may include being able to dialyse independently at home or to be involved in shared or self care in a satellite unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an exciting time for Renal services at MFT. In the past 3 years we have done extensive work to transform renal dialysis services across Manchester, Tameside, North Manchester and Altrincham . In early 2021 we will be opening a 6 bedded Haemodialysis Assessment Unit for all of our patients to be supported in when they start dialysis. Our vision is to work with patients to provide high quality dialysis care that meets the needs of the patient and is delivered at home or within a local dialysis unit where possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We strive for excellence and are looking for a motivated, passionate individual with substantial dialysis experience who has a passion for patient education and training. We offer excellent prospects for career development and the chance to enhance your skills in an interesting and developing area of our service. There will also be an opportunity to actively participate in quality initiatives to continually improve the service we provide. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For further details / informal visits contact:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;NameGillian DuttonJob titleWard ManagerEmail addressGillian.Dutton@mft.nhs.ukTelephone number0161 413 7760Additional contact information&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Emily Raybould, Renal Matron on Emily.Raybould@mft.nhs.uk&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=121137"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Home Training Dialysis Unit, Altrincham General Hospital, Altrincham", "postalCode": "WA142RQ"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "53.3849", "longitude": "-2.35154"}}, "title": "Staff Nurse - Home Dialysis Training Unit", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916248999", "validThrough": "2020-11-10T23:59:59+0000"}

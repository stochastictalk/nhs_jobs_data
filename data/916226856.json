SAFE is a multi-agency service made up of social workers, family support workers, pupil and family workers, an educational psychologist and family safety worker who offer early help and support to families.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;CAMHS is embedded within this team, and CAMHS clinicians work closely with multi-agency colleagues to undertake joint assessment and intervention, and to offer consultation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The CAMHS team is comprised of clinical and counselling psychologists, assistant psychologists, family therapists, CBT therapists, Child Wellbeing Practitioners and nurses. The service offers evidence-based interventions, including CBT, family therapy, parenting work, and group work.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We support young people and families who present with a wide range of mental health difficulties, often in partnership with education and social care colleagues.

It is the Trust\u2019s view that the costs associated with moving house in order to take up a post with us should not restrict our ability to recruit the excellent people we need, therefore we support staff to relocate with our relocation policy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This post requires the post holder to be able to undertake all statutory and mandatory training and post holders must be able to undertake physical interventions. Fitness for physical intervention will be assessed by Occupational Health.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A valid UK driving licence plus the use of own transport for business purposes is essential. For qualifying staff the Trust has a Lease Car Scheme in place and also offers a popular Salary Sacrifice Car Scheme with our partner Tusker.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To ensure you fully understand how the Trust, as a Data Controller, will process and store your data please read the attached document \u2018 Applicant and Staff Privacy Notice\u2019 prior to applying for the role.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Candidates for any staff appointment shall, when making application, disclose in writing to the Trust whether they are related to any governor.

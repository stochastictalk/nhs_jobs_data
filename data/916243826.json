You will be working as part of the High Weald, Lewes &amp; Havens Assessment &amp; Treatment Service (HWLH ATS) based at Hillrise in Newhaven.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Hill Rise is just a short car ride from Brighton or a 40 minute cycle ride along the beautiful costal road.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The successful candidate will join a friendly, highly-skilled and enthusiastic community of psychologists and psychological therapists working as part of the Assessment and Treatment Service for adults of all ages.

HWLH ATS is based across two sites \u2013 Hill Rise in Newhaven and Millwood in Uckfield. The post holder will be based at Hill Rise but may be required to travel between both sites at times. At present , as a result of the pandemic, we are offering many of our interventions online and this role can therefore currently involve time working from home if desired although this may change in the future.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Psychologists and psychological therapists are valued members of the service and offer specialist assessment; evidence based interventions; psychological formulation and team consultation. The successful candidate will have skills in offering neuropsychological as well as formulation based assessment to help develop a comprehensive understanding of a client&#39;s needs and guide care planning.

This could include working with clients with psychosis, trauma, managing complex emotions, mood and anxiety difficulties. We recognise the importance of offering evidence based psychological therapy and experience in offering Cognitive Behavioural Therapy within adult mental health services is essential. We also have local interests in third wave approaches within psychological therapy including Compassion Focused therapy, EMDR, and ACT and support the wider team to offer family interventions for psychosis. We would welcome the successful candidate to bring their own interests and experiences to this post and help us to continue to develop our psychological therapy provision.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust aims to realise the potential of everyone who uses its services and to enable staff to do a great job.

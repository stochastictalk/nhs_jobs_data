Our customers include more than 60 Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCG), NHS England/Improvement, local authorities and a range of care providers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With offices throughout the Midlands, North West and South East we cover a core geographic patch that extends to Greater Manchester in the north and Essex in the south. Our services are built on a strong foundation of experienced people who build great relationships, a commitment to NHS values and a thorough understanding of our clients and the challenges they face.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We provide real value to our customers by working at scale, creating the synergies and innovation that ultimately drives improved patient outcomes and makes commissioning resources work harder.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The post is to work closely with the South East Regional NHSE/I Direct commissioning team, developing reports and processes to meet their information requirements. The post is based in a small team providing expert information analysis and insight to inform decision making and service redesign across the South East region.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For further details / informal visits contact:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;NameFaizel MahomedJob titleSenior Manager DPRU ConsultancyEmail addressfaizel.mahomed@nhs.net&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/127894.jpg", "name": "NHS Arden and Greater East Midlands Commissioning Support Unit", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=127894"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "NHSE/I Regional Office \u2013 Oakley Road, Southampton, Southampton", "postalCode": "SO16 4GX"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "50.9233", "longitude": "-1.44876"}}, "title": "Principal Commissioning Analyst", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916259239", "validThrough": "2020-11-20T23:59:59+0000"}

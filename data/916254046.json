Line management for the posts would remain within the Trust, but professional support and direction would be provided by the IPC Nurse Adviser at the CCG.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The posts involve working across the health economy, interacting with colleagues in the CCG and Local Authority who support care homes , to identify and support care settings with cases and outbreaks of COVID-19, as well as with other infections which may cause problems in the winter months, such as norovirus or flu. This would involve reactive support visits as well as delivering training sessions - all training materials will be provided. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The post-holders will also support a network of IPC link practitioners in the care homes, who will be a key point of communication from each location.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;These secondments will provide the post-holders with the opportunity to develop skills and experience in teaching, audit, surveillance, data analysis and cross-organisational working, and to enhance their knowledge of infection prevention and control.

This will enable the traditional barriers to the delivery of health and care to be broken down to enable care to be delivered to a defined patient population, in a different way to meet the needs of that population, focused on prevention and personalisation of care, making best use of resources collectively.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The NHS Long Term Plan introduced PCNs as essential building blocks of every Integrated Care System. The postholder will have responsibility for leading and managing the community nursing workforce.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Community staff Nurse is expected to provide clinical care, innovative practice and support to the District Nurse Sister and Clinical Lead to our ever developing teams. This role will provide the opportunity to work closely with GP practices and other partners, in supporting patients with highly complex and often high acuity needs to prevent unnecessary hospital admission. This role requires an experienced clinician with team working and communication skills, delivering effective evidence based care to a defined demographic population with diverse health care and social needs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The successful candidate needs to be prepared to adapt to the changing needs of the Trust and the community models of care as they arise.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The centre is committed to providing the right candidate with a development programme that will not only enhance their academic qualifications and nursing interests, but will also provide an excellent foundation for professional development, as well as gaining an insight into the intra-organisational structure and processes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For further details / informal visits contact:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pam McIvor (Clinical Lead)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tel: 01609 767516 or 07786 198057&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Email: pamela.mcivor@nhs.net &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/120671.jpg", "name": "South Tees Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=120671"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Units 12/14 Omega Business Park, , Hambleton and Richmondshire", "postalCode": "DL6 2NJ"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "54.3507", "longitude": "-1.43824"}}, "title": "Community Staff Nurse (District Nursing Team)", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916253197", "validThrough": "2020-11-17T23:59:59+0000"}

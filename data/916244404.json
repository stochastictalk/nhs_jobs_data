It is the Trust\u2019s view that the costs associated with moving house in order to take up a post with us should not restrict our ability to recruit the excellent people we need, therefore we support staff to relocate with our relocation policy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This post requires the post holder to be able to undertake all statutory and mandatory training and post holders must be able to undertake physical interventions. Fitness for physical intervention will be assessed by Occupational Health.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A valid UK driving licence plus the use of own transport for business purposes is essential.

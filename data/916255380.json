The Royal Marsden serves a local, regional, national and international population from two hospital sites, Chelsea and Sutton. The state of the art Critical Care Unit (CCU) at The Royal Marsden, Chelsea, facilitates the provision of exceptional treatment and care to patients throughout critical phases of their cancer journey and received an outstanding rating from the CQC.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The 16 bed CCU on the Chelsea site is the only level 3 critical care facility dedicated entirely to cancer patients in the United Kingdom and boasts some of the best survival rates for critically ill haemato-oncology patients in Europe. We also have an additional 2 bed facility on our Sutton site which provides care for patients who are being stabilized prior to transfer to CCU in Chelsea. At the heart of everything we do within this highly technical area is the patient, often immediately post major, complex cancer surgery under a range of specialties, or experiencing acute complications of their cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are an open, dynamic and diverse team who are looking for Band 5 staff nurses with at least one year, recent, critical care experience to join us. We provide a supportive and encouraging environment for you to develop within a highly specialized area. Each successful candidate will have a named mentor and access to highly experienced Practice Educators.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There is plenty of opportunity for career development and progression at the Royal Marsden which is affiliated to Kingston and St Georges London University. The staff are provided with study leave for relevant courses and given the opportunity to attend critical care conferences. Once CCU staffs have obtained the necessary experience they are given the opportunity to undertake a Critical Care Course for which 60 credits are awarded.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For further details / informal visits contact:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Marinella Salavador - Marinella.Salvador@rmh.nhs.uk&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;CCU Sister&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=123033"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "The Royal Marsden Hospital, Chelsea", "postalCode": "SW3 6JJ"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "51.4909", "longitude": "-.172788"}}, "title": "CCU Staff Nurse Band 5", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916255380", "validThrough": "2020-11-18T23:59:59+0000"}

It is served by five NHS provider organisations whose services are commissioned by eight Clinical Commissioning Groups with 236 general practices between them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;By working together across Lancashire and South Cumbria over the past few years we have made great progress within our Stroke Services supporting improved patient experience and outcomes. We work closely across the trusts to share good practice and support each other and as a system we focus on all aspects of the stroke patient pathway from prevention to acute treatment, rehabilitation and life after stroke.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are continuously looking at how we can improve our services; our aspiration is for our stroke services to be amongst the best on offer in the UK. Whichever organisation you work for, you will find a local Stroke Improvement Plan which underpins a single Integrated Continuous Improvement Plan for Lancashire &amp; South Cumbria.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In addition to continuous improvement the key priorities for Lancashire &amp; South Cumbria are implementation of Integrated Community Stroke Rehabilitation, implementation of an Ambulatory Care Model (one-stop rapid assessment/diagnosis for TIA, minor stroke and stroke-like symptoms) and implementation of Hyper-Acute Stroke Units. The use of digital solutions to support the workforce and enable faster diagnosis and more efficient/effective treatment, rehabilitation and long-term support for patients post-stroke is also being progressed as a high priority.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are using the Stroke-Specific Education Framework across the region to: support staff with assessing their level of knowledge and skills; identify and prioritise training needs; and to explore new roles and different ways of working to support our service improvement work.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Lancashire and South Cumbria is a great place to live and work and we have a team of passionate, committed staff who want to make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Acute Stroke Unit has an exciting opportunity for qualified nurses to join our friendly, supportive and dynamic acute nursing team.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The ideal candidate will be expected to maintain high standards of care which we strive for within our stroke unit, meeting national and local guidelines \u2013the involvement of the stroke pathway begins in the emergency department and you will be contributing to the care and planning throughout the stroke pathway.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are a 24 bedded acute stroke unit.

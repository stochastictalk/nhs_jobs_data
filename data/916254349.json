Our role is providing rehabilitation and re-ablement to patients both from the acute and home, to assess their needs and aim to discharge back to their own home within 14 days. This role is Pathway 2.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being part of the clinical leadership gives a sense of ownership and pride in how your team performs.

The successful candidate will be helping to coordinate a portfolio of interventional and non-interventional clinical research studies, recruiting patients into surgical, oncology and COVID studies.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You will possess excellent communication and interpersonal skills in order to support patients and work effectively with colleagues. You will be required to collaborate closely with leading investigators, other research team members and the wider multidisciplinary team, to ensure the safety of patients throughout the trial. You will be required to manage your own workload, so a proactive, flexible and mature approach is essential. The need for accurate records within clinical research is fundamental, so excellent documentation skills, a meticulous eye for detail and a good standard of IT skill is essential.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The post-holder will be part of a small and dynamic team, so must enjoy working independently as well as part of a team. Experience in surgical or oncology pathways is essential along with the ability to understand clinical research.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The role is suited to someone who is organised, adaptable in their approach and has excellent verbal and written communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We offer a flexible approach to working hours to meet the needs of the individual and the service.

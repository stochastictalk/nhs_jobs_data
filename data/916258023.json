The Midlands Performance Analytical Team are looking to recruit a Senior Analyst. As a team, we are responsible for the collection, reporting and analysis of information about NHS operational activity and performance, and our team works with Regional Directors, Directors of Performance and many other directorates across the region to bring analysis to decision making. Examples of work include:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Developing performance metrics to understand how patients experience the NHS \u2013 for example analysing statistics on A&amp;E 4hr performance and considering options for any replacement. This also includes putting in processes for monitoring and identifying reasons for its variation.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Assisting with how the NHS plans for its delivery of services \u2013 enabling the annual planning round, working with regional Sustainability and Transformation Partnerships to help complete the required stages for planning. This includes producing analysis of their results to ensure that plans are cohesive and realistic.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Deep dive pieces of analysis \u2013 these are multiple and varied in their topic and method applied. Previous areas include modelling the impact of COVID on waiting times for treatments, and where to locate NHS Nightingale sites.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Projecting demand for NHS services and required capacity over the course of the year and future years. For example, how might services such as changing outpatient appointments from face to face to video affect the required capacity and what other impacts (positive and negative) might this change in service have.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For further details / informal visits contact:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Name: Performance and Analysis Team&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Email address: england.performanceanalysisteam@nhs.net&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/126694.png", "name": "NHS England and NHS Improvement", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=126694"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "St Chads Court, Birmingham", "postalCode": "B16 9RG"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "52.4723", "longitude": "-1.93413"}}, "title": "Senior Analyst", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916258023", "validThrough": "2020-11-19T23:59:59+0000"}

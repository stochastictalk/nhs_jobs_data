That&#39;s why we&#39;ve set up our &lt;strong&gt;Preceptorship Academy&lt;/strong&gt;, to help you get the very best start.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Your transition from student to registered nurse is one of the biggest leaps you will ever make in your nursing career. But you don\u2019t have to do it alone. Our preceptorship programme is designed specifically for you as a newly qualified nurse, to support you in that transition.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Working within a supportive clinically led team, you will have the opportunity to really work in partnership with patients - engaging, supporting and developing a relationship which really enables the recovery process. With a real commitment to improving care delivery, as part of our team you will be supporting quality improvements and initiatives that will enhance the patient experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We want you to feel equipped with the right skills to become a brilliant nurse. We will help, support and nurture you to become the best you can be. We will help you to develop in confidence as a nursing professional, enhance your skills and continue your journey of life-long learning.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;strong&gt;preceptorship programme&lt;/strong&gt; is also a great opportunity to map out your continuing professional development and consider how you want to progress your career as a nurse. You will reflect on and evaluate your role and identity as a nurse, and when you need that extra bit of support to help you through, we&#39;ll be here for you alongside your multi-disciplinary team.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The programme is designed and delivered by senior mental health professionals and peer trainers \u2013 people with lived experience of mental health services.

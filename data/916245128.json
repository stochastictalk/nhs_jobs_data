The post holder will be based at Newcastle University and Newcastle upon Tyne NHS Foundation Trust. Most clinical work in the first year will be undertaken in Newcastle Community Dental Service in Kenton.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Academic Clinical Fellowships (ACFs) are 3 year fixed-term national training posts. Trainees undertake 75% clinical and 25% academic training over the term of the post.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;ACF trainees undertake a Research Training Programme provided by the University for which funding is provided by NIHR. They also are eligible for a \u00a31,000 bursary per year to support research training activity (eg. to attend academic conferences).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;ACF trainees would also normally complete and submit an external funding application for a research fellowship to enable them to complete a higher degree (PhD or research MD) following the completion of their ACF fixed-term post,&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All Academic Clinical Fellowships are run-through posts. A trainee entering ACF at DCT1 would therefore be guaranteed continued training in DCT2 and DCT3, as long as they progress satisfactorily through their training via RCP.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please note:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All applicants will be required to undertake the national clinical recruitment process and attend an assessment/interview for Dental Core Training 1.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In addition to a local academic interview, clinical benchmarking is required. You must complete a separate standard clinical application form during the appropriate DCT National Round.

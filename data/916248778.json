You will provide evidence-based psychological interventions to people experiencing a wide range of eating disorders, many of whom present with comorbid mental health difficulties. The role will involve delivering individual and group interventions, as well as some joint work with our day service staff.

You will receive regular supervision and will have the opportunity to join our reflective practice group. Within the service we offer a range of evidence-based interventions, including CBT-ED, DBT, SSCM, MANTRA and psychodynamic psychotherapy. We also work closely with families and carers and you will have the opportunity to be involved in taking this work forward. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The service was rated \u2018good\u2019 across all domains in the last full CQC inspection (2014).

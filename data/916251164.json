Community services include a low secure unit, assertive outreach teams, criminal justice services including working with the Metropolitan and British Transport Police Forces and working in the area of fixated threat and stalking.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Due to several new developments within the service we are looking for enthusiastic clinical, forensic, or counselling psychologists to work within the secure inpatient service working across medium secure and low secure wards with some input to the learning disability and women\u2019s services.

The role includes direct clinical work as well as consultation and training with colleagues and other professionals.

The ethos of the service is based on recovery and enablement with focus on individual service user needs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The post requires a high level of written and verbal communication skills as well as an ability to engage well with both colleagues and service users. The role would also include supervision of more junior psychological staff as required.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The department is eclectic and a range of theoretical approaches are welcomed and provided, working individually, in groups and with families.

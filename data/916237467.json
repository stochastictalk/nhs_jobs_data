Public Health England and many of its employees will be in scope for transition to new organisations in Spring 2021. Any new or current employees working for Public Health England during this time, will receive appropriate communications and consultation prior to any formal transfer taking place. Employees who compulsorily transfer to successor bodies will remain on their existing contractual terms and conditions and this applies both to current employees and those recruited during the transition. The recruitment, growth &amp; development of our workforce is vital for the continuing success of PHE and thefuture National Institute for Health Protection.&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Open to all external applicants (anyone) from outside the Civil Service (including by definition internal applicants).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Public Health England provides strategic leadership and vision for protecting and improving the nation\u2019s health. Its ambition is to lead a transformation in the health expectations of all people in England, regardless of where they live and the circumstance of their birth. It will achieve this through the application of research, knowledge and skills. PHE is an executive agency of the Department of Health. It is a distinct delivery organisation with operational autonomy to advise and support government, local authorities and the NHS in a professionally, independent manner.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Emerging Infections and Zoonoses (EIZ) Section is currently within TARGET (Tuberculosis; Acute Respiratory, Gastrointestinal, Emerging and zoonotic infections; and Travel health) division of the National Infections Service.

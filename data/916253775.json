The GP working day is currently Monday to Friday 8.00am \u2013 6.30pm, the role would need to fit within these hours but there is flexibility on start and finish times.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are looking for an experienced Occupational Therapist to work at an advanced practice level (Band 7)based in Primary Care in Sheffield. This is an exciting opportunity to co-design and develop a totally new role of occupational therapy within the Primacy Care Network of SAPA5 (Shirecliffe, Southey, Parson Cross and Shiregreen areas) in the North of Sheffield. This is a development post for one year with a view to future permanent recruitment and we would welcome applications from occupational therapists with physical and mental health experience. As GPs we are extremely optimistic about the impact this role could have for our patients and we would love an OT to become integral to our teams in the long-term.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our network covers 6 GP practices in a largely deprived area of the city (Barnsley Road Surgery, Buchannan Road Surgery, Elm Lane Surgery, The Health Care &amp; Dunninc Road Surgery, Norwood Medical Centre and Shiregreen Medical Centre). Our patients have a considerable burden of physiological and physical mental health problems with a very high prevalence of long term conditions, often experienced at a young age. This can therefore impact on their ability to work and enjoy life. We feel an OT is ideally placed to work in and ultimately lead a team in our network. You will need to work holistically with patients to improve their health and enable them to achieve an active and fulfilling life.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The post is open to Occupational Therapists who are able to be released on a 12 month secondment basis from their employing organisation or are able to take up a fixed term contract, initially for one year, with a view to a long-term post. We would require the applicant to have experience in one or more of our priority areas i.e. multi-morbidity, chronic pain, chronic mental health problems, dementia or frailty. The successful applicant would require excellent communication and networking skills, along with a proactive and compassionate leadership style.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you are interested in finding out more about this new role or would like an informal discussion, please contact Dr Susie Lupton, Norwood Medical Centre via email at Susie.lupton@nhs.net&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Central Advertising - General Practitioners", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=130654"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "SHEFFIELD", "postalCode": "S5 7HD"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "53.4131", "longitude": "-1.46982"}}, "title": "Primary Care Occupational Therapist", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916253775", "validThrough": "2020-11-17T23:59:59+0000"}

This opportunity has arisen due to imminent retirement.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The post is based at York Hospital and covers work across associated sites.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The role will focus on MSK ultrasound, CT (including dual energy) and MRI reporting and there will be opportunities to develop subspecialty interests. Excellent relationships with our Orthopaedic surgeons and Rheumatologists are maintained by weekly MDTs. A monthly infected arthroplasty MDT and 6 monthly sarcoma meeting provide added interest. The candidate will be encouraged and supported to strengthen the busy MSK interventional service covering a broad range of image-guided procedures, including bone biopsy and RF ablation. Equally there will be exciting teaching and research opportunities. A new orthopaedic centre of excellence in York is developing links with the Trust.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The role includes a commitment to general responsibilities in the department. Acute CT and MRI reporting is team-based within a recently established Acute Reporting Hub, allowing radiologists to focus on their subspecialty whilst supporting the general acute work. All radiologists contribute a 2-hour weekly session as the Duty Radiologist. On call is currently outsourced from 9pm and approval has been given to reduce the on-call commitment further.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;York Hospital has 2 MRI scanners and 3 CT scanners. Scarborough Hospital has 1 MRI scanner (upgraded 2018) and I CT scanner with funding approved for a second. We will be submitting a bid for SPECT CT soon.

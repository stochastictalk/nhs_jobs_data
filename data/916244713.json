Some people with diabetes develop serious complications with their eyes, called diabetic retinopathy. If they don\u2019t get this treated properly, it can lead to sight loss. Diabetic eye screening is a test to check for eye problems caused by diabetes. The eye screening test can find eye problems before sight is affected. Pictures are taken of the back of the eyes to check for any changes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Who are InHealth Intelligence?

Ward 32 is a very busy surgical ward with a vibrant and dynamic team. We are a very friendly team.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Ward 32 cares for a mixture of elective and emergency surgical patients. You will be dealing with acutely unwell patients with varying complex needs. We transfer patients to Intensive Care and also receive patients from the Intensive Care Unit. You will have ample opportunity to learn and develop yourself as a Band 5 in this supportive environment. We are also in the process of developing an Enhanced Surgical Care Unit. This will be a specialist unit that is dedicated to care for post-operative surgical patients who otherwise would require HDU care.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We have a strong clinical leadership with a Band 7 Practice Development Nurse and a robust nursing management structure and support network. We require someone with excellent communication and interpersonal skills as well as an organised person with a positive attitude who is flexible and proactive. The Trust and the Ward are extremely keen to develop you as a staff nurse and there is a wealth of training opportunities for you to select.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Tunbridge Wells is a vibrant and thriving town with historical sites as well as excellent schools, superb shopping and theatres.

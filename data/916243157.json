We were one of the Top Ten trusts in England for improvements in our emergency care access standards last year. We have also recently invested \u00a36.2m in improvements across our emergency floor.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We operate two Emergency Departments in Ashford and Margate. Both departments have excellent transport links through the High Speed Line to London and Eurostar into continental Europe. The William Harvey Hospital in Ashford provides full district general facilities in addition to Primary PCI and HASU for the surrounding areas. We are also a Trauma Unit which regularly receives Major Trauma and Helicopter emergencies from KSS air ambulance and Coastguard. The Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother Hospital in Margate also provides district general and HASU facilities, and also provides a helipad for the KSS air ambulance. Both sites have co-located Urgent Care Centres and the Care Group also provides Urgent Care facilities at Kent &amp; Canterbury Hospital and Buckland Hospital Dover.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speciality Doctors in Emergency Medicine \u2013 12 PA\u2019s (10DCC &amp; 2 SPA)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Applications are invited for speciality grade doctors with at least 2 years\u2019 experience in Emergency Medicine who wish to gain further development, either as part of a broader training experience or for those wanting to progress to a career as an Emergency Medicine Consultant. We would, of course support the training &amp; development of our staff to excel within the speciality.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;New staff are offered a robust orientation and given a dedicated clinical supervisor to support your development and orientation to the Trust. In addition to our post-graduate medical offer of study leave and training budget (average of 10 days per year), the department also separately funds the essential suite of life support courses:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Paediatric Advanced Life Support&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Advanced Life Support&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Advanced Trauma Life Support&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The department also offers staff access to monthly departmental teaching which aligns itself to national emergency medicine training curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You will get the opportunity to work alongside our emergency medicine consultants, each with their own areas of specialist interest. We have a number of consultants within our team who are MRCEM/FRCEM examiners and joint EM/ITU and EM/Paeds EM consultants who are committed to developing staff within EM and their specialist areas.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We would actively welcome applications from doctors who wish to develop a specialist interest area, and support them in their development of these areas.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Examples of special interest roles we have within our services are:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Silver fellow (frailty, geriatric trauma)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Intensive Care Medicine&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Simulation, Education, non-medical advanced clinical practice&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Paediatric Emergency Medicine&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our Speciality Doctor training programme provides development opportunity for those wishing to transition into Consultant posts with support to complete CESR. This will include a dedicated consultant supervisor and the opportunity to undertake 3 month secondments into areas such as Anaesthetics, ITU and paediatrics to help complete the educational competency required.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There will be a new medical school opening in east Kent from 2020, offering 100 training places per annum. We have been working closely with university partners and other Kent Trusts to see this to fruition and would strongly welcome applicants who may be interested in joint academic and clinical appointments. In addition to the development of others, we are keen to support the professional and academic study of our workforce. This includes support to study post-graduate qualifications such as MBA or MSc or undertaking academic research.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For further details / informal visits contact:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Dr Andrew Mortimer Email: andrewmortimer@nhs.net, or via, Gerry Hook 01233 616171&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Dr Wayne Kissoon (Clinical Lead for ED at QEQM) Email: wayne.kissoon@nhs.net or 01843 225544 extension 6657&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=121462"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother Hospital, Margate", "postalCode": "CT9 4AN"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "51.3781", "longitude": "1.38941"}}, "title": "Specialty Doctor in Emergency Medicine", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916243157", "validThrough": "2020-11-09T23:59:59+0000"}

Regardless of where you are in your career, we are confident that we can offer opportunities for you to develop your clinical skills and knowledge. We will ensure you have all the core skills you need to confidently build relationships with our service users in order to best create and deliver an effective and personalised treatment plan with them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Alongside these core skills, you may be interested in offering psychological interventions, from brief clinical interventions through to specific psychological therapies, such as CAT, CBT or DBT. In this case we can either enable you to utilise your existing skills in this area and/or we can offer the chance to train in these approaches. There will also be opportunities to develop skills in non medical prescribing and other areas, as appropriate to your needs and interests.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are excited to welcome you to the team, and provide you with the support and training that will make you want to stay with us.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Minehead is the Gateway to Exmoor and attracts visitors to it&#39;s coastal location.

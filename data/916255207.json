In all settings you are required to be holistic in your assessment and intervention, in a patients home the context is different, how are they managing with their activities of daily? Is there food in the fridge? Are they seeing anyone other than you? And if you arrive and they aren\u2019t well, you will have to decide what you are going to do.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When you come into this role you will be shadowing an experienced community nurse initially before heading out on your own and you will be trained in all the skills and competencies you need.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The City team is split between the 2 City Primary Care Networks and carries a caseload of round 950 patients. It is a busy and supportive team who will help make your experience of working in community so enjoyable you may not ever want to work anywhere else!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We work 7 days a week, 365 days a year, there are a variety of shifts starting from 8am and continuing to 10pm when we handover to the Taurus overnight service.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you would like more information please email Claire James or Miranda Smith on districtnurses3@nhs.net&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/120745.gif", "name": "Wye Valley NHS Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=120745"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Hereford", "postalCode": "HR2 9RP"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "52.0391", "longitude": "-2.75472"}}, "title": "Community Staff Nurse - City", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916255207", "validThrough": "2020-11-18T23:59:59+0000"}

There are a variety of referral routes. The team is an integrated health and social care team and as such also performs delegated functions on behalf of the local authority.

You will carry a caseload and contribute toward assessment, planning, implementation and review of care. Your unique skills will be valued and utilised. The team also works closely with primary care and other health and social care agencies, in addition to other local mental health teams, such as the Intensive Service, Primary Care Liaison Service, and inpatient services.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are looking for someone with a passion for mental health, and with strong assessment, care planning, risk management and intervention skills. You can expect to receive excellent supervision and to be able to engage with support from a range of highly skilled practitioners within the senior team to support you in your role. The work can be demanding, but within a supportive and skilled team. We are looking for someone who is committed to providing high quality support to our service users and those who care for them.

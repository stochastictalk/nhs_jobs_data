We are seeking to recruit two highly motivated individuals to join our busy and friendly team. You would be expected to work across both sites to gain exposure to all aspects of cardiology that the service provides. Currently the Maidstone site offers complex device implants and Electrophysiology, whilst the Tunbridge wells site offers PCI including PPCI (in hours), IVUS and pressure wire studies.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are a friendly and dynamic Trust situated in the heart of Kent. The local area has excellent schools and our department is family friendly. Both sites are within 1 hour commute to London. Kent is known as the garden of England, with beautiful historic villages in a rural setting as well as bustling towns.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our Trust\u2019s core catchment areas are Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells and their surrounding boroughs, and it operates from two main clinical sites: Maidstone Hospital and Tunbridge Wells Hospital at Pembury. It provides a full range of general hospital services and some areas of specialist complex care to around 560,000 people living in the south of West Kent and the north of East Sussex.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Due to a rapidly expanding cardiology service, significant investment is planned for the service. We are in the process of purchasing a 3D electro anatomical mapping system (Carto) and a new EP system. We already have an established EP service, and plan to extend this to complex EP. In addition, there are plans to expand &amp; redesign the Maidstone Cardiology site in 2021. This will provide an exciting opportunity to be involved in the cutting edge of cardiology and to help shape future cardiac services in Kent.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We offer regular training sessions, mentorship and engaged leadership at all levels. We have close links with Guys &amp; St\u2019 Thomas NHS Foundation Trust.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The post holders will be given an opportunity for development within the department including training in EP or complex device implants. Continued professional and personal development is actively encouraged and the successful candidates will be given opportunities and supported to develop their postgraduate skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The successful applicants should have BSc (Hons) in Clinical Physiology (Cardiology)/ BSc (Hons) Healthcare Science (Cardiac Science) or equivalent plus IBHRE or BHRS device accreditation. Ideally they should be registered with RCCP or HCPC or should have evidence they are working towards registration.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Please note that appointment to this post will be subject to a satisfactory Disclosure &amp; Barring Service Check at &lt;strong&gt;enhanced level.

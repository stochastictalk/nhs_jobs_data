We are seeking a highly motivated and dynamic individual with a keenness and ability to integrate your current skills and apply them in this context. Experience of working in a physical health setting is desirable, but we are also keen to hear from applicants who have been working in other specialities, who feel they have transferable skills. The most important qualities are good communication skills, working co-operatively and thinking creatively.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In return for your enthusiasm, hard work and commitment you will benefit from being part of an expanding and exciting service with good support structures and lots of variety within the role.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The post will be based at Cross Street Health Centre with other psychologists working in physical health but with the expectation that you will work closely with the MDTs that are based locally.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The post holder will be professionally allied with the Physical Health Psychology Service, with all the associated benefits of professional development, supervision and peer support.

Clinical and leadership supervision, and continuing professional development, are highly valued, with the wider Physical Health Psychology community coming together every six months for Summer and Winter CPD workshops. Additionally, there are opportunities to join peer supervision groups. We are able to offer great opportunities for career progression, with many members of the service seeking and successfully securing promotions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is what our staff have said about working in the service:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u2018The psychology team provided a number of opportunities for broadening experiences, and the roles are varied in nature.

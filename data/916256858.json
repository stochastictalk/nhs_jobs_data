Cycling, paddle boarding and sea swimming are not mandatory but are strongly encouraged in this department.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Emergency Department at University Hospitals Plymouth sees well over 100,000 adult and paediatrics patients a year and is a dedicated Major Trauma Centre for the South West of England covering a large geographical area. We have recently had agreed funding in excess of \u00a330 million to build a new Emergency Department and work is due to start in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The nursing team has seen several recent developments with an increase in the number of Band 7 Senior Sisters and an increase in Band 6 Sisters, this is an exciting time for a new nurse education lead to really shape how we train and educate our workforce for the next 5-10 years. Education of the workforce is at the heart of what we do, and with a rapidly changing medical and nursing workforce the educational needs are dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are striving to grow and shape into a premier emergency department with a thriving nursing team, who will work closely with the medical team to deliver excellent care to all of our patients. We have a consultant education lead and now we need a nursing lead, is this you?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are looking for a dynamic educator who can successfully plan and deliver a training program in line with the RCN Emergency Nursing Framework and differentiate between level 1 and level 2 nurses in the department. We are looking for someone with the ambition to negotiate a post graduate course for our staff to achieve these very competencies. We need to be delivering world class trauma nursing care and to do that we need a trauma nursing education plan which keeps us up to date with all of the national and international developments.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This post needs a true educator who is ready to take the next step in their career and lead the educational plan for this Major Trauma Centre into the next 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Please apply and you will be made very welcome by our phenomenal team.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For more information or an informal chat please contact David Smith - ED Matron on\u00a001752 437880\u00a0or david.smith137@nhs.net&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;***Preference will be given to internal Trust staff, as well as \u2018Priority\u2019 and &#39;At Risk&#39; status including NHS At Risk staff throughout Devon who are able to display recent relevant experience as dictated by the Person Specification.***&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/120815.jpg", "name": "University Hospitals Plymouth NHS Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=120815"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "PLYMOUTH", "postalCode": "PL6 8DH"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "50.4167", "longitude": "-4.11371"}}, "title": "Clinical Educator", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916256858", "validThrough": "2020-11-18T23:59:59+0000"}

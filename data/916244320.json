Following the National Maternity review \u2018Better Births,\u2019 it is clear that models of care where women know the midwife who is caring for them throughout their journey, have a positive impact on improving safety, clinical outcomes, as well as a better birth experience. This will also have an impact on reducing pre-term births, hospital admissions, and the need for intervention during labour.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In partnership with women, you will support informed decisions regarding place of birth, whether that is at home, in our midwife led birthing unit or consultant led obstetric unit, and develop mutually respectful relationships with both women and colleagues. This ensures that all women have access to the optimal birth environment in accordance with their choice and in line with evidence based practice. Midwives are consequently supported and enabled to practice in the optimal environments for all elements of midwifery care for all women (and their families) to enjoy a normal birth experience. You should be an experienced midwife, able to provide antenatal, intrapartum and postnatal care in line with the continuity of carer pathway.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You will provide a full range of health education, social care and advice to women, liaising with multi-disciplinary/agency groups are to continually improve maternity care for childbearing women and their families, being responsive to the needs of the women and obtain user views as appropriate.

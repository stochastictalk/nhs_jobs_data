We provide a comprehensive (mainly non-obstetric) ultrasound service to a wide range of specialities within the hospital and local GPs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At Hammersmith Hospital, we perform a wide range of ultrasound examinations including general abdominal, gynaecological, transplant kidneys, small parts, venous and carotid Doppler and contrast enhanced microbubble scans. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At Charing Cross Hospital, we perform general abdominal, gynaecological, small parts including Head &amp; Neck, venous Doppler, MSK and contrast enhanced microbubble scans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At St Mary\u2019s Hospital, we perform general abdominal, gynaecological, small parts, MSK and early pregnancy scans. We also have a busy recurrent miscarriage clinic where we provide ultrasound services to investigate for congenital uterine anomalies using 3D TV scan. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Experience in MSK would be preferable but is not essential. We would support training in MSK scanning by encouraging attendance to courses and working with MSK consultants in order to gain knowledge and experience and to eventually deliver independent MSK sessions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Posts are available at Hammersmith Hospital, Charing Cross Hospital and St Mary\u2019s Hospital. Sonographers are not required to rotate between sites and current working hours are Monday to Friday, 08:30 to 17:00 but this may change in the future to provide 7-day service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All three departments are excellent to work in, where further training and development is supported. Regular meetings are held to discuss interesting cases. You will be expected to work independently, however support from other sonographers and radiologists is always available and encouraged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Candidates must hold PG (cert), PG (Dip) or DMU or equivalent and be state registered with the HCPC if you have an underlying profession. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imperial College Healthcare NHS trust is known around the world for our expertise and outstanding clinical services.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the UK\u2019s first Academic Health Science Centre, we combine the healthcare expertise of our people with the academic excellence of Imperial College London.

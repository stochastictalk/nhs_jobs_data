UCH at Westmoreland Street has 9 beds and takes mostly high risk, complex surgical patients. Then, from October 2020, we will be opening our new state-of-the-art cancer facility which has 10 beds primarily taking haematology patients.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A recent peer review described us as \u201cclearly a standard setting unit with \u2026 excellence\u201d that \u201cother units would benefit from\u201d. National audits show that we have some of the best outcomes in the country, and, within the Trust, the Unit gained Exemplar Ward status sooner than any other department. Our research programme and quality improvement initiatives are nationally leading, and many of our nurses have been finalists or have won awards at the Trust Excellence Awards.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why work with us?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We recognise that our staff are our most precious resource and we are committed to you reaching your potential by offering a structured development and education pathway.

The Trust is a designated Major Trauma Centre, operates Europe\u2019s largest Critical Care Unit and Organ Transplant Service and, through its hosting of the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine, provides a full range of medical services to injured military personnel. UHB has achieved Global Digital Exemplar status, an accolade that recognises its digital maturity and creates a framework for the Trust to share its knowledge and innovations with other care providers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The IT department, which is believed to be the biggest of any NHS Trust in the UK, is now looking to further expand its team of specialists through the recruitment of a Principle SQL Database Administrator / Analyst.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The department is expanding in order to meet the Trust\u2019s digital demands, particularly in the \u2018new Covid-19 world\u2019. A Transformation programme of work is under way to create a truly agile and digital-first Trust, enabling colleagues at each of the Trust\u2019s sites to provide seamless care remotely where necessary to protect both patients and staff. This includes the rollout of a number of industry-leading clinical systems across all sites, some of which have been developed in-house.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Trust will also be moving over to N365, a version of Microsoft Office designed specifically for the NHS, and requires talented and motivated individuals to deliver this programme of work. With more than 20,000 colleagues in the Trust, this is a significant project that will help to standardise ways of working and communicating across the Trust, which has legacy disparate programmes resulting from the merger of Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust and University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust (2018).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Successful applicants will divide their time flexibly between working from home or at one of the Trust\u2019s various locations in Birmingham and Solihull. Therefore, candidates will need to be able to travel to and work from Birmingham and Solihull.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If this sounds like something you would be interested in please get in touch as we&#39;d love to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For more information please contact Paul Fletcher on 0121 371 2128 or 0787 944 0428 or paul.fletcher@uhb.nhs.uk&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=123452"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Birmingham", "postalCode": "B15 2TH"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "52.4533", "longitude": "-1.93628"}}, "title": "Principle SQL Database Administrator / Analyst", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916224024", "validThrough": "2020-11-06T23:59:59+0000"}

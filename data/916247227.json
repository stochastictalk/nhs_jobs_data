You must therefore disclose on your application form all convictions,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 cautions, youth cautions and youth conditional cautions, which are not protected. Guidance and criteria on the filtering of cautions and convictions and what you must therefore disclose on your application form can be found on the Disclosure and Barring Service website.

We have been advised by North East Essex Clinical Commissioning Group that this contract will be provided by another organisation after 30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;th&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; June 2021. This is not as a reflection of ACE but due to the Commissioner wanting to make changes to the way the service is delivered. At the present time we don\u2019t know who the new provider will be but the CCG is working to determine this by the end of 2020. This change does not affect our ability to recruit and should you be employed at the end of June 2021 you will transfer to the new provider on the same terms and conditions \u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Working for ACE puts you right at the heart that all North East Essex has to offer. If you are looking to re-locate to the area then we may be able to help with your moving costs. Further information can be found in the Relocation policy.\u00a0 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Colchester is Britain\u2019s oldest recorded town and now one of its fastest growing with a range of recreational facilities to match. The jewel in the crown of its historic past is its Norman castle, built on Roman foundations. A wealth of new homes is complemented by an equally broad selection of character homes in the plethora of picture-postcards villages that surround the town. The likes of Sible Hedingham, Finchingfield and Dedham (the latter being the heart of Constable Country made famous by the artist John Constable) are much sought-after location. Within a stone\u2019s throw of Colchester you have 60kms of beautiful coastline including Blue Flag beaches, the gentile charm of Frinton and the more bustling Clacton \u2013 one of the driest places to live in the UK! \u00a0In addition North Essex boasts several nationally acclaimed schools, including Colchester Royal Grammar School and Colchester County High School for Girls. London Stansted Airport is less than an hour\u2019s drive away while all the attractions of London itself are within easy reach. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Anglian Community Enterprise (CIC)", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=125574"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Colchester", "postalCode": "CO4 9YQ"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "51.9237", "longitude": ".921483"}}, "title": "Speech and Language Therapist, Band 5", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916247227", "validThrough": "2020-11-10T23:59:59+0000"}

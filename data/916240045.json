The successful candidate will complement a multidisciplinary team consisting of experienced medical and nursing staff. Their particular focus will be on delivering psychologically informed services to patients, their families/carers and the wider healthcare system. This will include providing specialist assessments, and formulation-driven evidence-based interventions for presentations ranging from self-harm in the context of crisis, to functional or medically unexplained symptoms in the context of psychiatric presentations. It will also include providing training, supervision and reflective practice to both support the development of the MHLT and increase the knowledge and skills of staff within the Acute Hospital. An interest and commitment to quality improvement will be valued, and the role will involve working closely with the Clinical Lead to evaluate the effectiveness of the service in line with the recommendations of the Royal College of Psychiatrists: Faculty of Liaison Psychiatry. Supporting the service to achieve PLAN Accreditation will be an important aspect of the role. Similarly, the successful candidate will provide clinical leadership in the development of psychological-informed interventions to complement the delivery of care from across the range of medical specialisms.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This exciting and challenging role will require an ability to work independently and under pressure, whilst at the same time complementing the team ethos through a willingness to work flexibly with colleagues to meet the demands of a fast-changing workload. Consultation will be a significant aspect of the day to day work and familiarity with a wide range of assessment methods is essential.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Mental Health Liaison Services are expanding across NSFT and you will be joining a small but growing number of Psychologists working locally within this specialism. The postholder will have the opportunity to join a county-wide Peer Supervision Group and will also be supported to engage with national professional networks for Liaison Psychology.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As the postholder, you would have professional links with the psychological team inputting to the other acute psychiatric services in King\u2019s Lynn \u2013 the 16-bed in-patient ward, and the Crisis Resolution and Home Treatment Team. You would also be part of a supportive and proactive wider psychology team of around 15 staff, working across two adult community bases as well as the acute setting. A range of specialist skills and interests are represented, including working with personality difficulties, trauma and dissociation, working with psychosis, CBT, ACT, Mentalisation Based Therapy, CAT, EMDR, Compassion Focused Therapy, Schema Focused Therapy, art psychotherapy, Psychodynamic Psychotherapy and Behavioural Family Therapy. You would also have important interfaces with Children, Families and Young Person\u2019s Services who see service users up to age 26, Clinical Health Psychology and Older People\u2019s mental health Services. The trust has a strong tradition of co-production and co-delivery of services with experts-by-experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There are good links with the UEA Clinical Psychology Training, and other professional training schemes, and you would be encouraged to offer trainee placements as appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The development of specialist interests and skills will be encouraged in line with service needs, and a dedicated CPD budget is attached to this post.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Psychology is a well-established and valued resource in the West and South Norfolk Care Group, and the work environment is pleasant and supportive. West Norfolk is a mixed rural and urban area and offers a high quality of life in terms of housing, culture and leisure pursuits. The beautiful Norfolk coast is on the doorstep, whilst there are good road and rail links with London, Cambridge, Norwich and the Midlands. Car ownership would be an advantage given the wide geographical area, but not essential as pool cars are available for clinical use.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Benefits included with this role are: -&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Dedicated \u00a33000 pro rata CPD budget&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Relocation Expenses&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;NHS pension&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;a comprehensive in house &amp; external training CPD programme&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;career progression&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;starting annual leave of 27 days per annum increasing to 33 days pa based on length of service (plus paid bank holidays)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;staff physio service&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;NHS discounts and many more.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For further details / informal visits contact:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;NameHelena CrockfordJob titleConsultant Clinical PsychologistEmail addresshelena.crockford@nsft.nhs.ukTelephone number07884 117251Additional contact information&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Informal contact and visits are encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Please contact :&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Helena Crockford, Consultant Clinical Psychologist, Adult Psychology Service Line Lead (West) on 07884 117251&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/121326.png", "name": "Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=121326"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Fermoy Unit, Kings Lynn, West Norfolk", "postalCode": "PE30 4ET"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "52.7568", "longitude": ".447015"}}, "title": "Principal Practitioner Psychologist", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916240045", "validThrough": "2020-11-22T23:59:59+0000"}

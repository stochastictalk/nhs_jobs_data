The teams are based in Yeovil and Taunton. The service has been designed to provide reactive and responsive assessment and treatment to patients at points of crisis, with the aim of preventing admission or readmission into our Older Persons Mental Health Ward.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In order to deliver this innovative way of working, we have created two really exciting opportunities for an Occupational Therapist to join each team. You will have a genuine opportunity to help develop and promote the service, providing you with a unique opportunity to develop your own professional portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You will have an Occupational Therapy qualification and experience of working in a community setting is desirable but not essential. You will work closely alongside the Band 6 Occupational Therapist and Mental Health Nursing colleagues to provide functional assessment of patients with dementia in their own homes, and assessment and development of non pharmacological behavioural approaches\u00a0to manage and understand challenging behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is an ideal opportunity for someone who wishes to develop their mental health experience whilst utilising their knowledge and skills around Occupational therapy. You will have opportunity to develop and improve your risk assessment skills, use recognised assessment tools, be involved in the implementation of risk management plans, and to demonstrate the ability to react to the changing needs of our patients.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You will receive formal supervision and appraisal from the Band 6 Occupational Therapist within each team.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;IDSS provides intensive support to patients and their families, 7 days a week between 8am and 8pm.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We have therefore, created a variety of shift patterns for you to choose from, allowing you to balance your work with the other things in life that are important to you.&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Somerset NHS Foundation Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=121360"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Wellsprings  Hospital Site, Taunton", "postalCode": "TA2 7AU"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "51.0324", "longitude": "-3.10144"}}, "title": "Occupational Therapist, Band 5", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916222095", "validThrough": "2020-11-10T23:59:59+0000"}

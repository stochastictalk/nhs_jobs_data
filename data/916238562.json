The two Trusts merged on 1st October 2020 to become the University Hospitals Dorset NHS Foundation Trust.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Stroke is at the forefront of these changes with the Stroke Services at The Royal Bournemouth Hospital and Poole Hospital coming together with an East Dorset Hyper-acute Stroke Unit being established at The Royal Bournemouth Hospital by September 2020. This presents an exciting opportunity for the post-holder to be directly involved in this significant transformation and the chance to help shape and develop innovative services and pathways for stroke and TIA.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Stroke service will include hyper-acute care, provision of 24/7 stroke thrombolysis, regional 7-day TIA service, stroke rehabilitation, stroke early supported discharge, stroke outpatient/follow-up clinics and stroke research.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There is an established MDT teaching programme and in-house Trust wide development opportunities in leadership, team coaching and delivering compassionate care.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The pharmacy services are well regarded in the Trusts and recognised as a key element to any clinical development. The Pharmacy team is forward thinking; we embrace change and are constantly looking for ways to improve the service. We understand the importance of good team working and have strong links with other professions. The patient is at the centre of all that we do and our strategy is to provide a pharmacy service that has medicines optimisation at its heart. EPMA (Electronic Prescribing and Medicines Administration) has been implemented at Poole Hospital and will follow soon at the Royal Bournemouth Hospital improving the way that we work.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Please search for our Pharmacy video on Youtube to learn more about us;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Pharmacy recruitment RBCH January 2020&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Why join us?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our staff say; \u201cWe have a very friendly, welcoming and supportive workforce that helps each other even when we are up against it\u201d, \u201cThe job is rewarding.

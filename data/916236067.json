You will not be able to submit your application after this time. Please ensure that you have completed all the relevant sections of the application forms as missing information will deem your application incomplete and it will not be considered.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Academic Clinical Fellowships (ACFs) are 3-year fixed-term national training posts. They attract an NTN(A) and trainees undertake 75 % clinical and 25% academic training over the term of the post. They are employed by the NHS Trust (in this case Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust) and have an honorary contract with the University of Sheffield. ACF trainees undergo training in the generic skills required for a clinical academic: scientific methods, statistics, research governance, critical appraisal of research publication, grant writing etc through postgraduate taught modules provided by the University of Sheffield and for which some funding is provided by NIHR. Academic Clinical Fellows may join with the well-established Sheffield medical ACF programme within the Graduate School of the Faculty of Medicine Dentistry and Health:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Trainees do not necessarily complete the whole Masters Programme in Research Methods; they can choose the modules most relevant to them, and also choose from the continuing development programme. The major part of the academic placement will be the preparation of scientific research proposal for a PhD project, funding for which will be sought from an external body such as the NIHR, MRC or the Wellcome Trust. Generally the preparation of the proposal is based on preliminary experimental data gathered while on the research placement. Trainees are also eligible for a \u00a31,000 bursary per year to support research training activity (e.g. to attend academic conferences).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;ACF trainees are expected to complete and submit an external funding application for a research fellowship to enable them to complete a higher degree (PhD) following the completion of their ACF fixed-term post, which would be completed as Out-of-Programme-Research (OOPR).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All Academic Clinical Fellowships are run-through posts, regardless of specialty. A trainee entering an ACF post would therefore be guaranteed continued training to CCST in Oral Medicine, as long as they progress satisfactorily (in both clinical and academic domains) through their training. We advise all applicants to read through all the relevant information available on the HEEYH Oral Medicine ACF Webpage and associated links before beginning your application through Oriel.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Including&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The Job Description&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The Person Specification&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The Timeline&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Interview Structure and location&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The qualifications and professional registration requirements plus other eligibility criteria can be found in the person specification.

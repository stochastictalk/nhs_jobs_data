There is the expectation that hours will be worked flexibly to meet the needs of the service and will include early morning and evening working. There may also be a requirement to travel to our spoke clinic in Haverhill.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is usually a two year training programme, however, a nurse with previous sexual health and/or contraception experience may not require the full two years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The successful candidate will be expected to enhance their knowledge and skills, undertaking the FSRH Diploma and the BASHH Sexually Transmitted Infections foundation course.

It is essential therefore, that candidates are committed to the provision of a holistic model of sexual health care, possess outstanding communication and interpersonal skills and an ability to work to a high standard within a small multi-disciplinary team. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hours: 37.5 hours per week, worked flexibly to meet service needs, including one early, 07.30, start and one late finish at 20.00&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you are interested and would like an informal chat please call Sue Fuller CNM or Chris Leathers Dep CNM on 01284 731843 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/125234.png", "name": "Cambridgeshire Community Services NHS Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=125234"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Bury St Edmunds", "postalCode": "IP33 2AR"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "52.2409", "longitude": ".721734"}}, "title": "Associate Clinical Nurse Specialist", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916258433", "validThrough": "2020-11-20T23:59:59+0000"}

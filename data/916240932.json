Public Health England and many of its employees will be in scope for transition to new organisations in Spring 2021. Any new or current employees working for Public Health England during this time, will receive appropriate communications and consultation prior to any formal transfer taking place. Employees who compulsorily transfer to successor bodies will remain on their existing contractual terms and conditions and this applies both to current employees and those recruited during the transition. The recruitment, growth &amp; development of our workforce is vital for the continuing success of PHE and thefuture National Institute for Health Protection.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Open to all external applicants (anyone) from outside the Civil Service (including by definition internal applicants).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Public Health England (PHE) provides strategic leadership and vision for protecting and improving the nation\u2019s health. Its ambition is to lead nationally, and enable locally, a transformation in the health expectations of all people in England, regardless of where they live and the circumstance of their birth. It will achieve this through the application of research, knowledge and skills. PHE is an executive agency of the Department of Health. It is a distinct delivery organisation with operational autonomy to advise and support government, local authorities and the NHS in a professionally independent manner.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Virology and Pathogenesis (V&amp;P) group at PHE Porton Down sits within National Infections Service (NIS) Laboratories, Research and Development Institute and TARGET. Its work focuses on arboviruses, viral haemorrhagic fevers and other emerging zoonotic viruses which cause infections in humans and pose a significant risk to public health as well as supporting the response to public health emergencies such as the West African Ebola outbreak in 2014 and the current COVID-19 pandemic. The group\u2019s activity corresponds with the institute\u2019s status as a WHO Collaborating Centre for virus research and reference (special pathogens) and ranges from the development of diagnostics and surveillance through to the assessment of interventions and vaccines. Working with academics, commercial companies and national infectious disease institutes in the UK and endemic regions we seek to identify, study, and reduce the clinical and economic impact of this broad range of novel and emerging pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The post holder should be educated to at least degree level in a relevant subject and have knowledge and experience in molecular virology. The post holder will take the lead in delivering an ambitious CCHFV research and surveillance project with collaborators overseas. This will require molecular assay development and validation coupled with assay training and implementation in disease endemic regions. The post holder will also support additional research projects within the group which may include, but is not limited to, virus isolation, development of recombinant virology assays, such as virus rescue from plasmid DNA, and minion sequencing with de novo genome assembly on clinical, and surveillance samples.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/127774.jpg", "name": "Public Health England", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=127774"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Public Health England, Porton Down, Salisbury", "postalCode": "SP4 0JG"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "51.1325", "longitude": "-1.7031"}}, "title": "Research Scientist (Virology)", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916240932", "validThrough": "2020-11-06T23:59:59+0000"}

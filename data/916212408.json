The Consultant Acute Physician is responsible for the care of all medical patients referred from GPs and A&amp;E, who are directly transferred to the AMU for quick triage, rapid assessment and treatment along with patients in the Ambulatory Emergency Care Unit. Responsibility for care of the patient is transferred to the relevant specialty consultants as soon as the patients leave the unit or they have been referred and seen by a subspecialty team.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Urgent medical patients receive early senior assessment and decision-making by experienced consultants seven days a week, supported by an enhanced multi-disciplinary team, to identify care needs and ensure patients are on the right pathway, first time.

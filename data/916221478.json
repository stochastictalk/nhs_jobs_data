Do you want to use your lived experience to help others?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An exciting opportunity has arisen for a passionate and self-motivated individual, with lived experienced of accessing children and young people\u2019s mental health services as a parent/carer to join our team in a peer support role, covering the Lincoln and Louth area. Please note, applicants who do not indicate they have lived experience in their application will not be considered.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Parent/carer peer support workers provide emotional support and practical assistance to parent/carers whose child/young person is currently open to CYP Mental Health Services. Through drawing from, and sharing, their own experiences a parent/carer peer support worker will inspire hope and belief that recovery is possible, and support families to feel hopeful about the future. This peer support role is also likely to include developing and co-facilitating parent/carer groups, including peer support groups (likely to be out of 9-5 hours)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Recognising the pivotal role parent/carers play in supporting their child\u2019s mental health, alongside the emotional impact of caring for a child experiencing emotional distress, this role will always involve supporting parent/carers to access support in their local community and, where appropriate, link to carer organisations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As the role will also involve gathering and representing the views of those we work with to improve the service, we are looking for individuals with good communication skills who are passionate about co-producing services with children and families. If you enjoy working as part of a team and want to make a difference in people\u2019s lives, then this may be the opportunity for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Please note, applicants will need to be able to travel independently across the county.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you would like to know more about this role, please contact Abbie Futter (CAMHS Peer Support and Involvement Lead) on 01522 535189.

My name is Danni and I am the Modern Matron of Lark Ward which is a psychiatric intensive care unit based at Woodlands in Ipswich. I wanted to personally introduce myself and explain to you why you should choose to come and join my team.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are a 10 bed unit supporting people at the most critical time of their Mental Health.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What comes to mind when you think of working on a PICU? Well, we are on a mission to challenge these pre -existing beliefs. As a team we are committed to working collaboratively with our service users and carers and we belief this this is the key to understanding the best way to care for our service users.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So why join my team?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m a realist, PICU is busy. The days are long as we work in an environment supporting people at their most vulnerable time. As a team we recognise this and make sure that all members of the team are fully supported and we look after you. I am really lucky to have a team of amazing Charge Nurses and CTL and our doors are open, we encourage our team to come speak to us. How can we expect you to look after others if we don\u2019t look after you?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Lark Ward has recently been part of a national QI programme to reduce restrictive interventions. We approached this with collaborative care at the front of our minds, asking the people in our care what they wanted from us. The results have been fantastic with a 40% reduction in our restrictive interventions. This has had a really positive impact on my team who have worked hard and together to achieve this, and all took an active part when we presented our successes across the country.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I understand the importance of a fresh way of thinking, I want people to join my team who will bring new ways of thinking with them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Whatever stage you are in your career NSFT will support you. We offer a truly unique preceptorship programme which is co-produced and co-delivered for our newest nurses. I want to recruit ambition, you will be encouraged to join one of our outstanding staff development programmes including our aspiring band 6, encompassing such modules as trauma informed care, human rights and collective leadership to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Working in a PICU is a brilliant platform to expand your skillset, we see people with a range of mental health conditions, offering opportunities to learn and giving you an underpinning knowledge you can take with you throughout your career.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What is it like living in Ipswich?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s great! Trip advisor recently names Ipswich amongst the world\u2019s top emerging destinations, the only place in the UK to make the list. Could it be that Ipswich is a destination that&#39;s managed to keep its historical charm intact and is a cultural hub of activity?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;From strolling through the arboretum at Christchurch Park, taking in a show at the famous Regent Theatre, viewing Constable&#39;s art at Christchurch Mansion, it is very easy to fall in love with Ipswich.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m sure part of the charm relates to Ed Sheeran being one of our most famous residents!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I would love you to come join my team and not only come work for me but come start a long and rewarding career at NSFT. If you would like more information please give me a call on 01473 891 720 or drop me an email Dannielle.Robinson@nsft.nhs.uk.

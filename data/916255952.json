It is a challenging environment that provides a service to patients with everything from minor procedures to complex surgeries.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Theatre department\u2019s reputation has continued to grow and provide excellent patient care. We have a fantastic clinical team, and our professional skills and positive team ethic were proudly shown on BBCs Hospital programme last Spring. If you have been inspired by the excellent skill and teamwork from Combined Speciality Theatres and want to help us make positive changes to patients\u2019 lives, we invite you to apply.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Theatre experience is desirable but not essential.

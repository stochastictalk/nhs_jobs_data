We are currently expanding our specialist workforce to meet the modernisation programme that will see the Emergency Department grow.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Clinical Decision unit is a 12 bedded 6 chair area for inpatients on the emergency pathway. The Clinical Decision Unit provides high quality patient care to assess a patient\u2019s medical condition, organise appropriate tests and further management to determine their need for inpatient admission.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In order to provide the highest quality of care for our patients we welcome nurses who are honest, reliable, a good team player as well as really caring about the contribution they make to not only patient care but also to their own personal and professional development, working environment and colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As we have strong links with local Universities an amazing benefit to joing the team is that we are committed to delivering work-based educational initiatives. We offer a band 5 development programme which includes in house accredited Foundations of Emergency Nursing Course.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you would love to be part of a fun, supportive team then please apply today.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Interview Date: To be confirmed&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For further details / informal visits contact:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Tracey Murphy: Matron, Emergency Department&lt;br /&gt;020 8836 4356&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/121183.jpg", "name": "Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=121183"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Queen Elizabeth Hospital, London", "postalCode": "SE18 4QH"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "51.4791", "longitude": ".051174"}}, "title": "Staff Nurse - Clinical Decision Unit", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916244834", "validThrough": "2020-11-19T23:59:59+0000"}

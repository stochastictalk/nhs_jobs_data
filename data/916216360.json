It was created to provide strategic leadership and to implement transformational change for General Practice. A significant focus for &lt;em&gt;One&lt;/em&gt;Norwich is the development of a sustainable General Practice focusing on capability and workforce capacity. The role of Clinical Pharmacists within General Practice is recognised as vital to create resilient primary care teams, able to provide an integrated, patient-centred service.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Primary Care Networks (PCN) are now strongly emerging as the new shape of general practice, as directed by NHS England. In Norwich, we have an established Primary Care Network made up of four defined groups of GP Practices, called \u2018neighbourhoods\u2019. The PCN neighbourhood will provide a dedicated focus to connect the local primary care and community teams. OneNorwich has been mandated by all Norwich Practices to provide the necessary transformation, infrastructure and support for Norwich PCN, ensuring that the NHS England Network Contract DES can be delivered. We continue to grow our team and seeking to recruit an additional 6 WTE Clinical Pharmacists who are keen to work within Primary Care Networks. This is an exciting opportunity to work as part of a dynamic, multi-disciplinary team, innovating and leading transformational change. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you are interested in joining our dynamic team please contact Duncan Martinez Hanson, PCN Lead pharmacist &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;duncan.martinezhanson@nhs.net&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Closing date:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; 23&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;rd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; October 2020&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interviews: &lt;/strong&gt;week beginning 26th October 2020&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Norwich Practices Ltd", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=135420"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Norwich", "postalCode": "NR1 1RB"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "52.6262", "longitude": "1.29898"}}, "title": "Clinical Pharmacist", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916216360", "validThrough": "2020-11-06T23:59:59+0000"}

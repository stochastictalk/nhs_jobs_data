You will join a single team of Emergency Medicine Consultants working across both our acute sites until they merge and work together on one site at the Midland Metropolitan University Hospital. All new consultants join the Trusts well established New Consultants Leadership Program.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Please note, there is also an opportunity to apply for the Clinical Director post within Emergency Care. Please note there will be a separate interview for this role which can take place on the same day of the AAC but not part of the AAC.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A community of half a million is eagerly anticipating the brand new Midland Metropolitan University Hospital. The opening will be the beginning of a fresh chapter in our ambitious journey to be the nation\u2019s leading provider of integrated care. The new state of the art acute hospital in Grove Lane, Smethwick will bring together all acute services onto one site. This will lead to a merger of the current two Emergency Departments (at City and Sandwell Hospitals) on to the single site promoting better patient safety and patient experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The single-site Acute Hospital will benefit from co-located specialist services which will support the new Emergency Department with dedicated imaging facility and Assessment Units. It will provide state-of-the-art treatment and care for patients from Sandwell and across the region and will become the civic heart of the area and a point of pride for the community.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You will be joining a busy Emergency Medicine team that currently sees approximately 200,000 patients per year across two hospital sites with a vision to move towards the new single site Emergency Department in Midland Metropolitan Hospital seeing 140,000 patients per year. This will make the Emergency Medicine department one of the largest and busiest in the country. A co-located primary care centre will see an additional 30,000 patients and a further 40,000 will be seen at a separate urgent care centre in Sandwell.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Trust is a key partner with the local commissioning group and the local authorities in the Right Care Right Here program which seeks to deliver a redevelopment of local health services. The program includes one of the largest investments in the UK with new facilities in both the acute and community sectors. Included within this is the new Midland Metropolitan University Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Trust has a very good reputation for undergraduate and postgraduate teaching with strong links to the University of Birmingham and Health Education West Midlands. The post holders would have opportunities to be a Clinical and/or Educational Supervisor to trainees in the Emergency Department; in addition you will have an opportunity to take on specific service development roles. The Trust is home to a number of University departments and we are now looking to develop research capacity in a number of specialties in the Trust including Emergency Medicine so there is likely to be opportunities to become involved in research activities.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Birmingham is a vibrant, multi-cultural city and it is a very exciting place to live and work.

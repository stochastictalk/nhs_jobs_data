We have exciting opportunities for our Consultants in Neonates as we look to develop and expand our service in line with the Critical care Transformation Review fully supported by our Neonatal Network. Recruitment will also support the transition with forthcoming retirements and the clinical teams are currently looking for support from the Trust to expand this single post to 2. We want candidates to share our passion and to drive forward changes for the care of Neonates.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We would particularly welcome applications from candidates who have the skills to undertake Neonatal Echocardiography and who have formally begun to develop these skills. This would be to support the Neonatal Cardiology service within Hull for both inpatients and outpatient follow up to 1 year alongside the regional cardiology service.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It is anticipated in due course that the Neonatal Service will expand by a further full time post in addition to replacing consultants as they retire. The Healthgroup are looking for approval for a 2nd post at Executive level in order to support succession planning.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Hull Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Hospital on the Hull Royal Infirmary site was opened in 2003 and is one of the group of hospitals comprising the Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust.

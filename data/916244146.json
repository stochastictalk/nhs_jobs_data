The title &#39;Royal&#39; was granted by Queen Victoria in 1837 in recognition of the hospital&#39;s work with cholera victims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In April 1991 the Royal Free Hampstead NHS Trust became one of the first NHS trusts established under the provisions of the NHS and Community Care Act 1990. On 1 April 2012 the trust was authorised as a foundation trust, under the name Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust. In 2014, Barnet Hospital and Chase Farm Hospital joined our foundation trust, bringing further medical expertise and local care to the NHS services we provide. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barnet Hospital first provided healthcare in an infirmary in the Barnet Union Workhouse in 1838. Chase Farm Hospital began as a home for pauper children in 1884. In 2004 Chase Farm made European history, by carrying out the first total hip replacement procedure with the patient leaving hospital in just 27 hours. At the time in the UK, the average length of stay following a total hip replacement was 11 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Across our three London hospitals, our vision is clear: to deliver world class expertise and local care. We combine globally recognised clinical expertise with local and friendly hospital care to represent the NHS at its best. Our mission is to be world class in terms of healthcare treatment, clinical research and teaching excellence. We aim to deliver and develop leading local healthcare in all three of our hospitals, to improve lives and help people thrive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Plastics Surgery department is based within a clinical network that has been established the Royal Free Hospital as the hub of inpatient and complex care and a number of spokes around North London, and the Home Counties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the Royal Free Hospital, the trust manages plastic surgery services in the following locations:&lt;br /&gt;Mount Vernon Hospital&lt;br /&gt;Watford General Hospital&lt;br /&gt;St Albans City Hospital&lt;br /&gt;Barnet Hospital&lt;br /&gt;Chase Farm Hospital&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Services are also provided at the following sites:&lt;br /&gt;Northwick Park Hospital&lt;br /&gt;Hillingdon Hospital&lt;br /&gt;Edgware Community Hospital&lt;br /&gt;Luton &amp; Dunstable Hospital &lt;br /&gt;Whittington Hospital&lt;br /&gt;University College Hospital&lt;br /&gt;Heart Hospital &lt;br /&gt;Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital&lt;br /&gt;Harefield Hospital&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Locum consultant post- Plastic Surgery&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A 12 month opportunity to join our busy and dynamic department that provides care both for the local population and much larger network around North London is available due to the current postholder taking a sabbatical.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The successful applicant will join a team of eighteen consultants.

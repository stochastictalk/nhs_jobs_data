You will not be able to submit your application after this time. Please ensure that you have completed all the relevant sections of the application forms as missing information will deem your application incomplete and it will not be considered.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Academic Clinical Fellowships (ACFs) are 3-year fixed-term national training posts. This part-time post provides the trainee with 25% academic time over the term of the post. They will be employed by Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and will have an honorary contract with the University of Sheffield. For the remainder of the week, the ACF will continue to work in their current post as a General Dental Practitioner or Community Dentist.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;ACF trainees undergo training in the generic research skills required for a clinical academic: scientific methods, statistics, research governance, critical appraisal of research publication, grant writing etc. This training may be provided by the University of Sheffield and for which funding is provided by NIHR. Academic Clinical Fellows will join the well-established Sheffield Integrated Clinical Academic Training programme . Trainees are also eligible for a \u00a31,000 bursary per year to support research training activity (e.g to attend academic conferences).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The major part of the academic placement will be the preparation of scientific research proposal for a PhD project, funding for which will be sought from an external body, such as the NIHR, MRC or the Wellcome Trust. Generally, the preparation of the proposal is based on preliminary experimental data gathered while on the research placement. ACF trainees are expected to complete and submit an external funding application for a research fellowship by the end of their post, to enable them to proceed to a higher degree (PhD).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All Academic Clinical Fellowships are run-through posts, regardless of specialty. A trainee entering an ACF post would therefore be guaranteed continued training to CCST in Primary Dental Care, as long as they progress satisfactorily (in both clinical and academic domains) through their training.

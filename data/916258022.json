The most recent guidance issued outlines the designation of Trusts as either Green, Blue or Yellow sites. Green sites are those which will be as COVID negative as possible, while Blue and Yellow sites will continue to treat COVID patients. We intend to become a Green site.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital NHS Trust (RNOH) is the largest orthopaedic hospital in the UK, and is regarded as a leader in the field of orthopaedics both in the UK and world-wide.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The RNOH provides a comprehensive range of neuro-musculoskeletal health care, ranging from the most acute spinal injury or complex bone tumour to orthopaedic medicine and specialist rehabilitation for chronic back pain sufferers. This broad range of services is unique within the NHS.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a national centre of excellence, the RNOH treats patients from across the country, many of whom have been referred by other hospital consultants for second opinions or for treatment of complex or rare conditions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Patients benefit from a team of highly specialised consultants, many of whom are nationally and internationally recognised for their expertise and experience. Consultants are supported in their work by nurses, therapists and other specialist clinical staff who are trained and are experts in their particular fields of orthopaedic care.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The RNOH plays a major role in teaching, 20% of all UK orthopaedic surgeons receive training here. Our teaching and clinical effectiveness are enhanced by our work in research and development and our academic links with University College, London. Research departments at Stanmore include the Institute of Orthopaedics, the Centre for Disability Research and Innovation, the Institute of Human Performance and the Centre for Biomedical Engineering&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The RNOH works closely with other hospitals and trusts, with whom we have joint appointments to ensure maximum availability of specialist skills for patients. Our patients benefit from access to Aspire Leisure Centre which is located on site and hosts first-class facilities for able-bodied and disabled people.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We need qualified nurses to join our in house Nurse Bank. The Nurse Bank provides temporary cover as a result of staff shortages or to cover short term unfilled vacancies.

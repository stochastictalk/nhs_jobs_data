We have great opportunities to work with experienced &amp; respected colleagues from all professions. The multi-disciplinary team is strong and expects collaboration on all areas of work \u2013 and new nurses joining the team will find a warm welcome as they are encouraged to engage fully with the team to work with service users.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NPU is housed at Fitzmary 2 Ward in Bethlem Royal Hospital, near Croydon. NPU offers a total of 23 beds to male &amp; female service users living with a severe &amp; enduring psychosis that has proven difficult to treat in their home boroughs. Our primary task is to apply modern research and use creative, professional working to identify treatment pathways with service users. Our aim is that each service user will have the very best chance to engage in decision making and maximise their own recovery \u2013 even where previous approaches have proven unsuccessful, possibly on multiple occasions. The work is challenging but rewarding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our service users are drawn from all areas on the country and they can struggle to engage with services or to join in formulation of care plans and pathways. Reasons for difficulties can often include, the distance from their home borough; the refractory nature of their illnesses; and the often lengthy process through multiple mental health services. At NPU the resources and experience will assist new staff to find innovative ways to engage the client group \u2013 and to reflect thoughtfully on the demands of the task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NPU is committed to evidence based practice and it will be an asset if postholders have an interest in research and in how it can be applied to nursing care work. There is a clear teaching aspect to the ward, with staff nurses receiving and cascading training as part of their routine work. &lt;br /&gt;SLAM is committed to the principle of learning from those who use our services, carers and families. We believe in the putting the service user at the centre of their own care process, and this is reflected in the day-to-day systems of all our wards. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will support the postholder first to complete all mandatory/statutory training, and then to consider planning their professional development. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our ward offers a national service, which means we are strongly resourced and motivated \u2013 but also means we require the very best staff in all roles, so that challenges can be overcome and service users can get the complex &amp; thoughtful support they need to progress. We support new staff well, but from an early stage staff nurses are expected to take on challenges and act as leads for roles that are important for the ward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We welcome applications from qualified RMNs, RNLDs or newly qualified students qualifying in 3 months&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If successful at shortlisting stage you will be contacted regarding the next stage. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;**Please note that if you do not state the month and year that you have completed your Nursing qualification you will not be invited to the assessment.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ward Name &amp; Location: Fitzmary 2, Bethlem Royal Hospital, Beckenham (Croydon)&lt;br /&gt;Patient Age Range: From 18 years&lt;br /&gt;Patient Gender: Mixed ward&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;South London Partnership&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The South London Mental Health and Community Partnership (SLP) is a collaboration between Oxleas NHS Foundation Trust, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, and South West London and St George\u2019s Mental Health NHS Trust, delivering mental health services to a population of more than three million people.

In June 30th 2020, the Pathology&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;laboratories at L&amp;D and Bedford merged LIMS systems and the Viapath contract ended.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A full business case was signed to consolidate Pathology services across the 2 sites and&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Bedford will be the hub for Microbiology under this full business case.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The successful applicant will form part of a team providing microbiology and infection&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;control services. It is intended that the appointee will have particular responsibility for&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;infection control. The Trust has seen a dramatic improvement in infection rates in the&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;last few years and is keen to appoint a candidate who can continue and improve on&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;this success.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is an exciting time for Bedford. Increases in the local population over the next ten&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;years will mean that the hospital will serve a community of over 500,000. The hospital&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;will continue to develop its clinical capabilities to enable it to achieve national and&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;international recognition.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Bedford is a thriving market town, which provides easy access to London (55 miles),&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;the North of England and beyond through its rail links and M1/A1/A14 accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An informal visit may be arranged by appointment with:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Dr Simantee Guha, Consultant Microbiologist \u2013 telephone 01234 355122 X 4703&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;(Secretary \u2013 X 4611)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Dr Fraser Mutch, Clinical Director of Pathology \u2013 telephone 01234 792325&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;(Secretary \u2013 01234 792628)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Closing date: 15th November&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Interview date: 14th December&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/120819.jpg", "name": "Bedfordshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=120819"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Bedford", "postalCode": "MK42 9DJ"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "52.1289", "longitude": "-.471708"}}, "title": "Consultant Microbiology", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916246547", "validThrough": "2020-11-15T23:59:59+0000"}

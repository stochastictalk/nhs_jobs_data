Patients with metastatic disease are cared for, using multiple lines of systemic therapy. The clinical practice is wide ranging and includes complex radiotherapy planning, palliative radiotherapy, SBRT, MR-guided radiotherapy, palliative chemotherapy, androgen-targeted therapies and radioisotopes for prostate cancer. A small number of penile cancer patients are referred to us for adjuvant or palliative radiotherapy each year. Participation in clinical trials is expected and leadership of clinical trials is encouraged. Clinical care across prostate and penile cancer is run as a team, with shared practice and shared patient care.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;No regular inpatient duties are required, but the post-holder would be asked to provide senior cover to the ward teams occasionally.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The key aim of this post will be to work together with the existing Consultant team to deliver a high quality clinical service. The post holder will make a major contribution to the Unit\u2019s programs of research.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The post holder will be based in Sutton but might be required to support services at the Chelsea branch of the Royal Marsden on occasion.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Full registration with the GMC is essential.

We are also part of the Virtual Ward (Frailty), which provides coordinated rapid care to people in their home who are experiencing an acute medical episode. We are seeking to appoint a Senior Nurse to work during the day as part of our nursing team to ensure that we continue to deliver outstanding patient care.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This daytime Senior Nurse role is a support function of the night service, working alongside a team of administrators and a Management Support Officer, acting as the first point of contact for patient referrals into the Neighbourhood Night Service. The Senior Nurse ensures that patient referrals are appropriately received, triaged, actioned and reviewed and outcomes communicated with relevant parties. They are responsible for coordinating the planned work of the Neighbourhood Night Service; acting as a key point of contact for all multi-disciplinary teams and ensuring communication is effective with staff on duty overnight and that any matters arising overnight are communicated effectively to relevant parties.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Neighbourhood Night Service operates overnight across the whole of Leeds providing care for patients requiring nursing intervention in their own home. The service operates centrally from Killingbeck. The key aims of the service include prevention of unnecessary hospital admissions and facilitation of Preferred Place of Care/Death for palliative patients where home is their preference. We are also involved in a Virtual ward (Frailty) to support patients in their own homes and avoid unnecessary hospital admissions. The Neighbourhood Night Service operates between 21:30pm and 07:00am. The Neighbourhood Night Service is part of a wider multi-disciplinary team ensuring the provision of 24/7 nursing care for patients in the community.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The senior nurse referrals coordinator would cover two shift patterns, ensuring the Neighbourhood Night service operates over the 24 hour period and that there are handover opportunities between the night and day elements of the team. The shifts would operate 07:00am-15:00pm and 14:00pm-22:00pm over seven days per week and would be allocated on a rota basis.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There will also be an expectation that you work clinically during the night approximately 3-4 shifts per month, to maintain clinical skills and understand and support how the service operates overnight. The clinical shift times would be 20:45pm-07:15am.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You will be a registered staff nurse and have excellent assessment, planning and evaluation skills in order to ensure that planned patient care is timely and appropriate. You must have excellent communication, organisational and IT skills as you will be coordinating care for a large number of complex patients.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A full tailored induction programme will be supported and ongoing development encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re getting excited just reading this, go ahead and apply.&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/123892.jpg", "name": "(AS) Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=123892"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Leeds", "postalCode": "LS14 6FD"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "53.806", "longitude": "-1.48042"}}, "title": "Clinical Referral Coordinator", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916246331", "validThrough": "2020-11-18T23:59:59+0000"}

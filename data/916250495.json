Warrington and Halton Teaching Hospital has been rated \u2018Good\u2019 in its most recent CQC inspection.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Cardiology team are looking to appoint a Locum Consultant Cardiologist ideally with a sub-specialist in cardiac imaging to join our existing team of Cardiologists. This is a 12 month fixed term post based at Warrington Hospital; the post holder will be encouraged to participate in the development of cardiac services as part of our cardiology transformation project. The appointee will play a key role in the development of our services and will contribute to acute cardiology and the provision of outpatient clinics.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Cardiac imaging has developed significantly at the Trust in the last 18 months and the services ambition is for at least two dedicated imaging Consultants.

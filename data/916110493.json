Our own process ensures we consider candidates on the merit of their application only and we do not ask any questions regarding a disability as part of our selection process. We only give candidates the opportunity to share information regarding any disability &lt;strong&gt;after &lt;/strong&gt;candidates are invited to interview and &lt;strong&gt;only &lt;/strong&gt;if the candidate feels they require adjustments in the interview process.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Priory Medical Group", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=130874"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "York", "postalCode": "YO24 3WX"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "53.9495", "longitude": "-1.12943"}}, "title": "Clinical Pharmacist", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916110493", "validThrough": "2020-12-08T23:59:59+0000"}

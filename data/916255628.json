Collectively, the two hospitals have 1,440 beds, revenue budget of over \u00a3500m and approximately 10,000 staff. Moving to a group model but retaining the existing boards, will enable KGH and NGH to integrate their clinical services whilst developing innovate approaches to streamlining pathways, with a clear focus on doing the right thing for patients every time. Working together, they will also design more effective ways in which corporate support services are provided, including the establishment of a new shared corporate services hub that will harmonise processes across the two organisations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Group has ambitious to become a university hospitals group and with major capital investment approved by the Secretary of State is now planning to reshape the estate and its technology assets to rival many of the most modern acute care facilities at a scale that will attract the best available talent in the market. With a number of Group roles now in place, we are now seeking to appoint a Group CDIO to develop and deliver our Group Digital Strategy. This is a Board level appointment and the post holder will be an Executive member of the Board of Directors at each Trust and report to the Group Chief Executive Officer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The key responsibility of the CDIO role is to ensure that the Trust has a cohesive, engaging and deliverable digital strategy that reflects the values of both Trusts and the needs of patients. The group CDIO will lead our digital and information technology transformation across both sites to create a strong, values-based culture which is vital to the success of the new organisation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We need kind, compassionate and inclusive leaders who will both make great things happen in each Trust and bring people together and with them on our ambitious group journey. For this role, this will require an individual with substantial Board or senior management level business transformation and technical experience in large complex organisations (in or outside the NHS) leading on digital, IT and information services. Experience of working with agile methodologies will be an advantage.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For further details / informal visits contact:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nick Cole E &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nick.Cole@Veredus.co.uk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; M 07736 491804 or Neal Mankey E &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neil.Mankey@Veredus.co.uk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; M 07541 644162&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Closing date: 12 noon on 20th November&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interviews to be held: 15th December&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/120843.png", "name": "Kettering General Hospital NHS Foundation Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=120843"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Kettering General Hospital, Kettering", "postalCode": "NN16 8UZ"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "52.4028", "longitude": "-.741278"}}, "title": "Group Chief Digital &amp; Information Officer (CDIO)", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916255628", "validThrough": "2020-11-20T23:59:59+0000"}

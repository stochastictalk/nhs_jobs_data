This work aims to develop advanced artificial intelligence approaches for the rapid contouring and planning of palliative radiotherapy, to enable safe, affordable and rapid delivery of radiotherapy treatment for acute oncological conditions related to locally advanced and widely disseminated cancers, within 10 minutes of receiving a CT scan. The particular focus of this automated treatment planning approach is for patients from low and middle income countries where only 10-40% of patients have access to radiotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The study at Guy\u2019s Cancer Centre is in partnership with the MD Anderson Cancer Centre (USA) who are leading the study and Stellenbosch University Cape Town, South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Department of Medical Physics at Guys &amp; St.Thomas\u2019 provides a comprehensive range of scientific and technical services to the Trust and external organisations. We are looking for experienced candidates capable of undertaking a diverse range of work related to this project, particularly clinical data curation and annotation as well as supporting clinical teams. Previous involvement in radiotherapy research is desirable.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in this post and would like an informal discussion then please contact Dr Ajay Aggarwal (Consultant Clinical Oncologist), email: ajay.aggarwal@gstt.nhs.uk or Tony Greener, Head of Radiotherapy Physics, Tel. 02071887188 ext. 57539, email: tony.greener@gstt.nhs.uk.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For further details / informal visits contact:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;NameAjay AggarwalJob titleConsultant Clinical OncologistEmail addressajay.aggarwal@gstt.nhs.ukAdditional contact information&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Tony Greener, Head of Radiotherapy Physics&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;tony.greener@gstt.nhs.uk&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;020 7188 7188 x 57539&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/121066.jpg", "name": "Guy's and St. Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=121066"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Guy\u2019s Hospital, London", "postalCode": "SE1 9RT"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "51.5046", "longitude": "-.088964"}}, "title": "Treatment Planning Dosimetrist", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916255435", "validThrough": "2020-11-17T23:59:59+0000"}

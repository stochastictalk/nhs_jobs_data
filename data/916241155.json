It\u2019s why we prioritise staff development, career progression, work-life balance and staff well being so that you can be the best nurse for your patients.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To us these aren\u2019t just buzz words. They are values that we pride ourselves on.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Staff development&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;From in-house specialist training academies to our close links with Kings College University whichever speciality you choose to work in, there will be a structured training programme for you to follow. Each of our clinical directorates has a team of practice development nurses who will work with you to identify your learning needs and appropriate training courses.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Career progression&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We want all our staff to achieve their potential with us. Whether you are looking for a career in management, as a specialist nurse, in education or as a future head of nursing, our dedicated retention team and career coaches will talk to you about your options, career pathways and most importantly, what we can do you help you achieve your goals. Our mobile career advice trolley visits clinical sites regularly bringing the support to you and our internal transfer policy makes it easy for you to make the most of opportunities within the Trust.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work-life balance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We know that working shifts and juggling life can be hard and at GSTT we want to ensure that our staff are given support to help them achieve a healthy balance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We have a flexible working policy that encourages staff to have conversations with their managers about their individual circumstances ensuring that all requests are given fair consideration. Our ward managers receive training from our amazing e-roster team to help them create equitable staff rotas. These are monitored by the nursing workforce team to ensure that there is safe staffing across clinical areas and also to ensure that all staff are working reasonable shift patterns.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Staff Wellbeing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When you join GSTT, you are joining a family. We are committed to looking after the physical, emotional and mental health of all of our staff and have a number of different schemes to promote staff well being.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;From 24 hour free counselling, to reduced membership at our onsite gym and swimming pool, there is something for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want to know more?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We know that nursing at GSTT is fulfilling but don\u2019t just take our word for it.

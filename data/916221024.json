We were founded in 2004, and we are different to most healthcare organisations for three reasons.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We have an open and honest culture, which allows our employees to feel empowered and a Circle credo which all our employees are aligned to.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We run healthcare in a new way: we put front-line clinicians, doctors and nurses in charge. By giving them responsibility and freedom, we believe they will run more effective, safe and caring services.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;And finally, we run some completely new types of service. We built independent hospitals which pioneered five-star hospitality in the UK, and we\u2019re the only organisation running some innovative types of work in the NHS, like our Bedfordshire musculoskeletal contract.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Role &amp; Responsibilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Working flexibly, as part of the community services clinical team, to provide the highest standards of nursing care to our patients; to maintain high standards of communication throughout clinics, and to make a positive contribution towards the team\u2019s pursuit of excellence.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Full time 37.5 hours per week- part time considered&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Person Specification:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience in a similar role&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;NMC registration&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A calm, caring and empathic attitude towards patients, relatives &amp; colleagues&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;An ability to communicate effectively with people at all levels,\u00a0 with a commitment to collaborative working&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Excellent standard of patient care&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;27 Annual Leave with additional days after qualifying period&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Cycle to Work Scheme&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Pension Scheme&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Employee Assistance Programme&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Private Medical Insurance&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Non-contributory Life Assurance and Income Protection Insurance&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Employee discounts platform&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Childcare Vouchers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Season Ticket Loan&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Circle Health", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=134174"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Wolverhampton", "postalCode": "WV13 3SW"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "52.5909", "longitude": "-2.08518"}}, "title": "Registered Nurse Dermatology Community Clinics", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916221024", "validThrough": "2020-12-11T23:59:59+0000"}

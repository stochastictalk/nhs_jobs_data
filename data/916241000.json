This is an exciting opportunity to be fully involved in developing and creating the highest quality service provision for service users and their families / supporters from the start and we need you to help us achieve this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our aim is to provide a multiagency/ multi skilled team to support families and young people in Crisis by delivering short-term, recovery-focused interventions and brief home treatment plans. The Team will have experienced clinical leaders working alongside support staff to deliver planned episodes of care and ensure young people have access to appropriate support.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are looking for practitioners who are passionate, dynamic, and skilled professionals and support staff who are ready for a new challenge to significantly improve children\u2019s experiences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The permanent posts are eligible for a \u00a33000 New Hire Bonus.

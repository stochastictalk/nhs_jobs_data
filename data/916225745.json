It is a two minute walk from Edmonton Green train station (overground) and is 0.8 miles from the A10. Walking through the relaxed grounds does not give the impression that it is set in Central London and this promotes the safe and therapeutic environment which Priory Hospital Enfield has developed and established to ensure patients receive the best care.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The hospital encourages a Multi-Disciplinary approach to delivering care, and this allows patients to receive a comprehensive care pathway during their admission to the hospital. The therapies provided for Service Users can be tailored to meet their specific needs and there are opportunities for all staff to receive extra training in the therapies being delivered.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The hospital provides three service lines across four wards:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Acute mental illness (12 bedded mixed sex ward)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;2 Medium Secure male wards (1 sixteen bedded acute and 1 fifteen bedded recovery)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;1 Low Secure male ward&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The hospital has a flexible approach to service delivery, and this is seen through the development of a new acute ward which is due to be open in Spring 2020. This is an opportunity to join an evolving service which puts patient care as our main priority!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ready for the recognition&lt;em&gt;and rewards you deserve?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;We don\u2019t just talk about putting employees first. We know that Priory wouldn\u2019t exist without their combined energy, expertise and effort. So we invest heavily in training, provide first-class support, promote collaborative teamwork and give everyone on our team the opportunities and resources to achieve their full potential. All roles will be subject to a successful disclosure at an appropriate level from the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS).

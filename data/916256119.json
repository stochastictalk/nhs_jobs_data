Our team works in partnership with teams across NHS England and Improvement to support programmes and policy areas with strategic finance advice and input. Your work will include working on strategic financial parts of the community pharmacy contract at a national level, but will likely include different programme areas across the 12 months.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Financial Accountability and Transformation team works with clinicians and managers who want to improve the way the NHS works to understand the cost of new proposals, to support negotiations with the Department of Health and Social Care and HM Treasury for any additional funds required, and to ensure that the financial incentives in the system are aligned to delivering better care for patients.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;With the results of the Treasury\u2019s Spending Review due in the next few months, and the developing clinical landscape because of COVID, this is an exciting time for community pharmacy and to be working in the strategic finance directorate. The successful candidate will help to support negotiation and implementation of the community pharmacy contract for next year, influence the Department of Health and Social Care\u2019s work on prescription charges, and continue work to improve the efficiency of community pharmacies. In addition to this, the successful candidate will support work to reduce the cost of fraud and error to the NHS through the Pharmacy Exemption Checking Scheme.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We are looking for someone with NHS finance experience.

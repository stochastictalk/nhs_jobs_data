We see the role of the Pharmacist as critical within General Practice. As one of the first joint posts across the PCN, the Pharmacist will be in a unique position, to help shape our longer-term strategy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Across the Practices we have a rich diversity of staff, including GP\u2019s, Physician Associates, Advanced Nurse Practitioners, Nurses, Healthcare Assistants and Practice based Clinical Pharmacists.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Network is seeking to recruit a Clinical Pharmacist to further improve the already excellent quality of service offered to the local population.

Within the first year we would be looking for the pharmacist to work across the Network to achieve joint aims for all three practices, as well as possibly looking at individual work within the practices. This would then be built on in future years. The role is diverse and will likely evolve depending on the needs of the PCN and the ability of the post holder. You can expect the role to include telephone and face to face consultations, repeat prescribing (where applicable), medication reconciliation, audits, high risk medicine monitoring, CQC preparation, implementation of local/national guidelines and general quality improvement across the region of the PCN.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;AT Medics Newham Central PCN will host this role because of their expertise in developing and managing Pharmacists.

Here are some of the reasons we\u2019re unique\u2026&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We are part of the Richard Bright Renal Unit, a regional renal transplant centre with six Haemodialysis Satellite Units across Bristol area. Our Trust is a centre of excellence for the delivery of care for people with renal impairment and our teams are proud to participate in pioneering clinical trials, including H4RT, Prepare for Kidney Care and the Bioempendence Trial.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;As a nurse working in our service you will be supported to learn the skills required to manage patients requiring renal replacement, both haemodialysis/haemodiafiltration and peritoneal dialysis, as well as gaining experience looking after those patients who have undergone a kidney transplant.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We are passionate about professional development. Within our Individual Performance Reviews, our nurses can share their personal career aspirations with the senior team and discuss opportunities available for additional training, including external specialist renal courses and internal management training hosted by the Learning and Development team at our Southmead site.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But it\u2019s not just our Acute Dialysis Team which are impressive; our trust itself is pioneering, progressive and proud. Let us tell you a little more about it\u2026&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We\u2019re committed to supporting staff on their career journey with us offering personalised training packages and bespoke specialty rotations. We also support internal transfers for those who wish to gain experience in a new specialty or further develop their skills.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;We value staff feedback; in the results of our 2019 staff survey, our response rate was &lt;strong&gt;higher than the national average &lt;/strong&gt;and highlighted we had improved in all the areas staff told us were priorities in 2018. Out of the 90 questions asked, we had made 73 improvements from the previous year and 69% of staff would recommend our organisation as a place to work (6% better than the national average).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Our nurses don\u2019t shy away from a challenge in aid of Southmead Hospital Charity. They cycle, run, row and race in aid of a fantastic cause, or sing in our staff choir and compete in \u2018Southmead Does Strictly\u2019.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Our staff are consulted on equity issues across the trust within equality and development groups, and given the mentoring and support to succeed. Our trust supports the development of Bristol\u2019s LGBT+ manifesto and a case study of good practice has been reported to NHS England in response to a government review of public services and Trans people.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right, that\u2019s enough about us\u2026 let\u2019s focus on you. Are you\u2026&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;An experienced Haemodialysis nurse with the passion and talent to progress clinically and professionally?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;An experienced nurse who would like to learn new skills within an exciting specialty&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We have a vacancy within our Acute Dialysis Team, who carry out haemodialysis/hemofiltration and plasma exchange as well as our ward nursing team; both roles are based within the Renal Ward.

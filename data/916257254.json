However, a science-related undergraduate degree will be considered. It would be an advantage to have successfully completed ARTP Parts I&amp;II or the ARTP Practitioner Qualification. Previous experience within a lung function/respiratory physiology laboratory is desirable.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These are exciting times for the lung function unit due to ever expanding services and plans for innovative service delivery. Co-location of Royal Papworth Hospital onto the Cambridge Biomedical Campus will undoubtedly bring future benefits with service integration planned.

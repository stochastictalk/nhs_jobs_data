It is the Trust\u2019s view that the costs associated with moving house in order to take up a post with us should not restrict our ability to recruit the excellent people we need, therefore we support staff to relocate with our relocation policy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A valid UK driving licence plus the use of own transport for business purposes is essential. For qualifying staff the Trust has a Lease Car Scheme in place and also offers a popular Salary Sacrifice Car Scheme with our partner Tusker.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To ensure you fully understand how the Trust, as a Data Controller, will process and store your data please read the attached document \u2018 Applicant and Staff Privacy Notice\u2019 prior to applying for the role. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Candidates for any staff appointment shall, when making application, disclose in writing to the Trust whether they are related to any governor.

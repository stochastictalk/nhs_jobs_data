The service provides stepped care treatment for people with mild, moderate and severe common mental health problems such as anxiety and depression.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;An exciting opportunity has arisen for 3&lt;span&gt; full-time High Intensity Therapists/CBT Therapists&lt;/span&gt; to join the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Psychological Wellbeing Service (PWS) on a 12 month fixed term basis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We have positions available across our Teams based in Cambridge and Huntington.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;*Due to COVID, all our staff is working remotely. This is regularly reviewed in line with government and CPFT guidelines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We are looking for individuals ideally with CBT based backgrounds, although will consider other therapy modalities, particularly those aligned to IAPT programme, eg. IPT, DIT, Couple Counselling, Counselling for Depression or Mindfulness. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We offer a high standard of supervision to our clinicians that far exceeds the nationally set minimum requirements within IAPT services. Monthly line management and annual appraisals are offered in addition to regular clinical supervision, and supervisors and line managers work closely together to ensure a supportive and developmental environment. We also offer excellent CPD opportunities within the service. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The service has recently benefited from increased investment, which has led to associated increase in the numbers of patients entering psychological treatments and increased range of interventions and initiatives undertaken by the teams. The successful candidates will therefore need to be flexible, evidence reliability and demonstrate the ability to cope with a demanding job. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The post holders will be enthusiastic, hard working and able to meet specified targets in order to deliver a high quality Primary Care Mental Health Service to the local population.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;*We would also consider applications for part time work (minimum 22.5 hours/week required). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For further details / informal visits contact:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;James Clarke - Service Lead Psychological Wellbeing Service&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;james.clarke@cpft.nhs.uk&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;01480 458888&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Michelle Espley&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Email: michelle.espley@cpft.nhs.uk&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/121760.JPG", "name": "Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=121760"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Chesterton Medical Centre, Cambridge / Huntingdon", "postalCode": "CB4 1PX"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "52.2194", "longitude": ".135919"}}, "title": "High Intensity Therapist/ CBT Therapist", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916255378", "validThrough": "2020-11-29T23:59:59+0000"}

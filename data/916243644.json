Each of the colleagues has a strong general/specialist respiratory background and we are delighted to offer this replacement post to support the service based at St. Helier Hospital, Sutton, London (part of Epsom &amp; St. Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Applicants with sub-speciality clinical interest (EBUS /ILD or other) are welcomed and will be supported by the Department.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a Department we are one of the biggest units in Southwest London, spread across two hospital sites (St Helier Hospital and Epsom Hospital). We have 8 substantive Respiratory Colleagues, covering a large catchment area of Southwest London and Surrey. The successful candidate will join a team of 7 substantive Consultant colleagues, at St Helier Hospital (3 colleagues: Drs Varney/Medveczky/Getsova and this post) and Epsom Hospital (4 colleagues: Drs Ratoff/Rahman/Wells/Molanguri). There are close ties between the two sites, including MDT, departmental meetings, audit and shared pathways with specialist clinics at Epsom (e.g. Pleural Clinic with indwelling catheter insertion service).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At St Helier Hospital we provide Respiratory input in general and sub-speciality clinics (Asthma/COPD/ Allergy-Immunology/ Cancer and Tb), share a weekly bronchoscopy rota and contribute towards the General (Internal) Medicine on-call, non-resident with 1:16 rota.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Consultants at St Helier site have further support from an Associate Specialist, two Specialist Registrars, junior doctors and a team of experienced Specialist Respiratory Nurses/Tb and Lung Cancer nurses.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The post is a 10 PA post.

Due to the nature of medical - on calls a dual CCT accreditation with the GMC in Respiratory Medicine and General (Internal Medicine) is essential.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Epsom &amp; St. Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust is a University teaching hospital with strong links to the neighbouring St George\u2019s Medical School, University London. There are many opportunities to get involved in undergraduate and postgraduate teaching and training, and the Respiratory Department plays an integral role in this commitment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are proud to have excellent links to our neighbouring Trusts (Royal Marsden/ St. George\u2019s Hospital University of London) for provision of Oncology, Thoracic Surgery and EBUS.

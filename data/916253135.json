Our newly refurbished unit offers 12 inpatient beds including a high dependency room. We also offer day patient and outreach treatment. We are based on the pleasant Ida Darwin hospital grounds in a village called Fulbourn, situated close to the centre of Cambridge.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We view eating disorders, particularly anorexia nervosa as chronic illnesses. While recovery is usual, we know this tends to take a long time. We therefore see the goal of treatment at the Phoenix Centre as helping young people improve the degree to which they can control their illness, rather than be controlled by it. This allows for more &quot;normal&quot; family, social and educational experiences and reduces the risk of young people being &quot;lost&quot; to mainstream life.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We focus on improving motivation for recovery (having things to get better for) and listening and including a young person&#39;s own goals is a big part of the way in which we work. In some instances, our goals have to initially be more limited e.g. to save life and restore weight, with the aim of helping the young person to see that more might be possible later.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Please take the time to look around our website.

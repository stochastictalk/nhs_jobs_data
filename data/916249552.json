We are looking for a Health Care Assistant to join our team.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You will be a valued member of our Outpatient team supported by our experienced Manager, Ewa. As a Health Care Assistant you will not only support the nursing staff; you will also participate in the pre-assessment of patients, undertaking basic tests and investigations under supervision. This will include vital signs recording, venepuncture, ECG recordings, urinalysis and peak flow recordings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You will have completed your NVQ Level 3 in Health and Social Care or be willing to work towards it and hold your BLS certificate.

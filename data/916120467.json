But don\u2019t just take our word for it, our staff are our most passionate ambassadors:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am Listened to\u2026\u2026&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I was born in Cumbria but trained and worked in other cities before deciding to return to my home county. There is nowhere better to bring up your family, so near to the Lakes, mountains and beaches and Carlisle is a great city with all the shops and entertainment that you need. It\u2019s a great location for getting to airports and has great rail links so if you enjoy travel (and I do) it\u2019s perfect. This Trust has been wonderful to me, after I took a career break I came back in at the bottom of the career ladder as a Healthcare Assistant and the Trust has supported me academically and professionally through a degree and now a Masters. I have risen from a Healthcare Assistant to my new role \u2013 Head of Nursing. I am really passionate about this Trust and getting it right, I am on the frontline, delivering emergency care to my community and work in a great team where our views are listened to by senior management. I wouldn\u2019t want to work anywhere else.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elizabeth Klein \u2013 Head of Nursing, North Cumbria Integrated Care NHS Foundation Trust&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With a competitive relocation and benefits package, supportive preceptorship programme which ensures you aren\u2019t left alone to cope until you have developed your confidence, we truly believe we are an Employer of Choice for 2017/18\u2019s best nurses.

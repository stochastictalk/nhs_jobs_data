This offers an exciting opportunity to join an established group of therapists to offer a quadrant wide therapy service within the community mental health team who provide a local DBT service, as well as joining the wider network of therapists across the trust. The service works to meet the needs of service users who are experiencing significant difficulties with emotional instability and risk to themselves, working within the local multi-disciplinary community teams. We pride ourselves on the quality of the service that we offer and place importance on supporting all our therapists to provide great care, with an emphasis placed on maintaining and developing therapist skills and regular supervision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This post would suit someone with a core mental health qualification and registration (including nursing, social work, occupational therapy, or other appropriately registered therapists - see person spec for details) and with an interest of working collaboratively with service users (and their families) to develop their skills to improve their ability to tolerate and manage strong emotion. Also it would suit someone who loves working as part of a therapy team and alongside multidisciplinary colleagues, supporting their practice . We are looking for someone who has experience of working with this service user group in community settings. Ideally they will have experience, or training in DBT or SCM, however we are happy to consider to individuals able to commit to completing these trainings - which will be provided.

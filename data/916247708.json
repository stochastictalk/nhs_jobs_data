Many in our team have joined us from other parts of the country, not the least because of the countless advantages life in Somerset can offer. Not far from bustling metropolitan areas, such as Bath, Bristol, and Exeter or the beautiful seaside, the county is rich in stunning and tranquil locations. Many appreciate that the cost of living and housing is considerably lower here than in the city and families value the safety of Somerset as well as the multitude of clubs, centres, and cultural venues where they and their children can get involved. Colleges and a number of excellent schools ensure good educational opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YOUR ROLE&lt;/strong&gt; as a PWP will be to provide evidence based low-intensity CBT interventions to our patients with low mood and anxiety through a variety of deliveries such as telephone, face to face, online and to support our busy course programme.

We are forming several working partnerships with local hospitals and LTC services such as heart failure, COPD and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We have a strong supervision model that provides weekly, individual case management supervision, monthly clinical skills supervision and monthly line management. You will be joining a service which values PWP development and wellbeing, there are opportunities to develop your skills and explore areas of specialised interest through various CPD, national IAPT conferences and workshops, supervision training, top up LTC training and opportunities to progress in the service.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In order to safeguard the health &amp; wellbeing of our patients and workers, our service is currently offering all interventions remotely by telephone or face to face on video platforms. This allows our clinicians to work from home where appropriate, or they can offer such remote interventions from our office bases. This has been a very successful change for the effectiveness of our work. In the coming months we intend to return to some selected venue-based, face to face work to facilitate patient access to treatment. We will continue to offer flexibility around remote working moving forward so we welcome applicants who reside outside of the Somerset area.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For further details contact:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Emily Hector, Senior Psychological Wellbeing Practitioner (Bridgwater) - emily.hector@somersetFT.nhs.uk&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jasmine Hutton, Senior Psychological Wellbeing Practitioner (Wells) - jasmine.hutton@somersetFT.nhs.uk&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Somerset NHS Foundation Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=121360"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Somerset Wide, Teams based in Wells, Chard, Bridgwater or Taunton", "postalCode": "TA6 4RN"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "51.1479", "longitude": "-2.99453"}}, "title": "Psychological Wellbeing Practitioner, Band 5", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916247708", "validThrough": "2020-11-15T23:59:59+0000"}

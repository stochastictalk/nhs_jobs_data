We promoted our service with our service users at an event for MPs in London in 2018, organised by the RCOT to raise awareness of mental health issues.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are looking for a self-motivated, energetic and creative clinician with relevant mental health experience and professional qualification ideally an Occupational Therapist.

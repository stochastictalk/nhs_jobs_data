We are able to offer a development post so that any newly qualified clinical psychologists are welcome to apply and if successful, they would be appointed to Band 7 initially and moving up to Band 8a when the necessary competencies have been met via the PADR process.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The county is a beautiful place to live, especially for those who enjoy outdoor activities. The post-holder will be expected to provide Psychology input into the locality team as well as contribute to more specialist centralised services. Special interests are encouraged whenever possible and there are regularly opportunities to be involved in new service developments.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The service operates using the Choice and Partnership Approach model of service delivery, it is forward thinking and performs well against Welsh Government targets for waiting times for first appointments. Applicants wanting full time or part time hours will be considered. Please contact Dr Andrea Mowthorpe, Lead for Psychology in S-CAMHS, with any enquiries: 01437 773774 or email: andrea.mowthorpe@wales.nhs.uk&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Interviews will be held on 16th November 2020.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For further details / informal visits contact:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;NameAndrea MowthorpeJob titleLead for Psychology in S-CAMHSEmail addressandrea.mowthorpe@wales.nhs.ukTelephone number01437 773774&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/123194.gif", "name": "Hywel Dda University Health Board", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=123194"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Withybush General Hospital, Haverfordwest", "postalCode": "SA61 2PZ"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "51.8127", "longitude": "-4.9651"}}, "title": "Clinical Psychologist", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916227560", "validThrough": "2020-11-08T23:59:59+0000"}

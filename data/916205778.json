As suggested by NHSE this is \u2018likely to be the most effective option in managing cross contamination and protecting patients not affected by Covid (GREEN) and at risk (BLUE) patients.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Service will be staffed by a variety of clinicians (dependent on need) including GPs, Nurses, Advanced Nurse Practitioners, Paramedics, Infection Control Coordinators and Service Administrators to enable the delegation of workload from GPs to other clinicians &amp; colleagues and to provide more specialised services to patients whilst maintaining the highest level of Infection Prevention and Control possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Each of the CALM services has an Infection Control Coordinator who will take overall responsibility of the day to day infection prevention and control measures we have in place and ensure all Infection Control procedures are strictly followed. PPE in line with national guidelines is provided for all staff working in CALM and all members of staff are encouraged to regularly review the latest local and national guidelines to ensure their practice is current.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;CALM clinics currently operate on a 5-7 day per week basis from 10.00am until 6.30pm. Shift durations may vary, but to ensure the wellbeing of staff we require all members of the team who are working for longer than 6 hours to take a minimum of 1 x 30 minute unpaid break during their session.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Once we have received sufficient appropriate applications, we may withdraw the advertisement.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No agencies please.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "TEMPORARY", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "OxFed Health & Care Ltd", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=134820"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Oxford", "postalCode": "OX3 9RF"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "51.7704", "longitude": "-1.22685"}}, "title": "CALM Clinic - Infection Control Coordinator", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916205778", "validThrough": "2020-11-27T23:59:59+0000"}

Care for patients with a multitude of conditions from neurological problems to end of life care. In addition to this we also look after patients with sub-acute needs and provide support through our training and development team for all staff to have the skills required to care for such complex patients. I support all of my staff to achieve the Trusts core competencies.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We have been involved in developing the Nursing Associate role at the Trust and offer development opportunities for support workers through apprenticeships from Level 2 to Level 5 including the opportunity to undertake university study to become a nursing associate.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I expect my all my staff to hold the values of the trust be courageous, ambitious, responsive, empowering and supportive.

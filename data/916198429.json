There is a thriving art and theatre scene, as well as an interesting variety of eating places, including celebrity-owned restaurants within Cornwall. The major route in and out of the county is the recently improved A30 which connects with the M5 motorway at Exeter. There is an excellent rail service, with daily passenger and sleeper services, and an airport at Newquay with daily connections to many cities throughout the UK and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you are thinking of joining us and have a partner or family who would relocate with you please contact us as we have a variety of employment opportunities within the hospital and would be happy to discuss this with you.

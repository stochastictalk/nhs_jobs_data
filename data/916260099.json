The BCHT Physical Health Psychology Service currently operates across 3 geographical patches (Dudley, Wolverhampton and Sandwell and West Birmingham) with a number of contracts in each area. This post will be based in Wolverhampton at Whitmore Reans Health Centre and New Cross Hospital providing psychological services for cancer within Wolverhampton CCG.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a perfect opportunity for a newly qualified psychologist, or a psychologist with previous experience who wants to develop their skills in physical health psychology. The post-holder will enjoy considerable variety within their role, providing bespoke individual and group psychological input, team formulation and consultation, supervision, training, and promoting psychologically-informed care in a range of community, outpatient and hospital settings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are seeking a highly motivated and dynamic individual with a keenness and ability to integrate your current skills and apply them in this context. Prior experience of working in physical health is not essential, and we are very happy to consider job share and flexible working arrangements. The most important qualities are good communication skills, working co-operatively and thinking creatively. There are often other opportunities arising within our service so this would be a great way of seeing what a career in our team has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The post-holder will be joining a supportive and forward-thinking team of psychological professionals who pride themselves on their commitment to the continual development and improvement of patient care. The Cancer Psychology Service is led by an 8B Clinical Psychologist, and also consists of a Psychological Counsellor. Team members hold a range of therapeutic interests including Cognitive Behavioural, Third Wave, Narrative and Psychodynamic approaches. Clinical and leadership supervision, and continuing professional development, are highly valued, with the wider Physical Health Psychology community coming together every six months for Summer and Winter CPD workshops. Additionally, there are opportunities to join Narrative peer supervision and other groups. We are able to offer great opportunities for career progression, with many members of the service seeking and successfully securing promotions. The post will have active links with, and support from, both the wider Physical Health Psychology Service and psychological professionals within Trust mental health services with opportunities for development via the Trust appraisal system.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For further details / informal visits contact:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Nameheidi napierJob titleclinical or counselling psychologistTelephone number07768 800603Additional contact information&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We would be delighted to meet with prospective applicants to discuss the post and provide an opportunity to meet current members of the team prior to the interview.

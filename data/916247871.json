This includes producing analysis of their results to ensure that plans are cohesive and realistic.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Deep dive pieces of analysis \u2013 these are multiple and varied in their topic and method applied. Previous areas include modelling the impact of COVID on waiting times for treatments, and where to locate NHS Nightingale sites.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Projecting demand for NHS services and required capacity over the course of the year and future years.

We aspire to deliver truly world class, holistic services within our outstanding, modern facilities. Our independence means we can always put patients\u2019 interests at the heart of decision making, while re-investing surpluses in frontline services. We are currently transforming the Charity to deliver \u2018Value Based Healthcare\u2019. This will ensure our patients consistently get the best possible outcomes and local teams gain more control and responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our patients and your colleagues will expect you to live the St Andrew\u2019s CARE values of Compassion, Accountability, Respect and Excellence every single day&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The ASD &amp; Learning Disabilities Division&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As part of our move to Divisions, we have established a new structure on our Northampton site that retains a clinically led approach, recognises our specialist areas of clinical expertise, has business units that are large enough to enable resources to be moved where they are needed, strengthens the nursing voice and reduces layers of management.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;St Andrew\u2019s ASD and Learning Disability Division seeks to improve the quality of life and reduce risk, in the least restrictive way possible, for individuals with a learning disability and/or ASD often with complex presentations. We provide assessment, resulting in a comprehensive formulation that informs the development and implementation of personalised, evidence based therapeutic interventions. Care is delivered across several facilities in Northampton, ranging from Medium Secure, Low Secure and non-secure rehabilitation services.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The learning Disability part of the Division works with adults with mild to moderate learning disabilities and/or other neuro\u2010developmental disorders who have offended or engage in challenging behaviours. Both Pathways provides a range of adapted treatment and offence related programme(s).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Staffing in both the LD and ASD pathways consists of a full Multi-disciplinary team, which includes specialists in Learning Disability and Autism. All staff undertake specialist foundation training in Learning Disability Awareness as well as Autism Awareness with some staff extended their qualifications in to specific areas of specialism.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Some of the main duties of a Senior Staff Nurse are to:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Plan, organise and deploy staff according to competencies and workload in order to meet patient needs.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Develop, implement, review and promote the importance of effective outcome focused care plans to meet individual preferences and needs, attending and contributing to ward rounds.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Effectively communicate with all MDT members, taking positive risks to manage the care environment and reduce the use of restrictive practices.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build and monitor ongoing relationships with patients, their families and carers to encourage trust, whilst listening to and interpreting their needs and concerns.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ensure all patient records, records of risk and interventions that have been taken, are up to date and accurate.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Use refection and supervision to learn from events and generate opportunities to improve patient outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Receive and provide clinical supervision.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Support thedivision to deliver specific outcome measures.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Complete required ward audits in line with the Clinical Governance strategy. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About you&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will have in depth experience of working with challenging patients in a mental health service.

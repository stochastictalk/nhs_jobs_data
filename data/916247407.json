Psychiatric Intensive Care is offered to service users who are compulsorily detained and require treatment in low secure conditions during an acutely disturbed phase of serious mental disorder. Within PICU all aspects of health, including physical health, social care needs and risk are jointly assessed by the multi-disciplinary team.

As well as the nursing and medical professions we also have a psychologist, occupational therapist, a visiting pharmacist and chaplaincy intervention. The PICU is a member of the National Association of Psychiatric Intensive and Low secure Units (NAPICU).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We also work in close partnership, and pro-actively with carers, family members, community teams and other outside agencies, to ensure continuity of care, implementing both psychological and psychosocial interventions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a Healthcare Assistant you will work alongside the MDT which supports individuals to develop and maintain their skills, promoting recovery and independence using a person centered approach.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The successful candidate must be committed, conscientious and motivated and have an empathetic and understanding approach to the people who access our service.

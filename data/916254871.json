Do you have an appetite for high performance and continuous improvement? Do you get a buzz from achieving in the face of adversity? Are you up for a challenge?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If the answer to the above questions is a resounding \u201cYes\u201d, then why not join the Acute Frailty Team at the Royal Lancaster Infirmary, a part of the University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay Trust (UHMBT), where you will provide key medical interventions and investigations for this growing cohort of patients.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are offering an opportunity for an enthusiastic and committed Consultant to join a forward thinking team and be part of the redesign and remodeling of the workforce.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The 2020 pandemic has encouraged many people to re-evaluate their lifestyles and the opportunity to now relocate to areas of recognised natural beauty such as the Lake District and Yorkshire Dales National Parks, both of which are within easy commute of the historic city of Lancaster, may now be a serious option for you and your family to consider? These more tranquil environments allow the pace of life outside of work to be ideal for genuine rest and relaxation, a huge improvement to the quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The lifestyle in this area can be either city, coastal or rural based, whichever suits the individual\u2019s tastes, with the opportunity to delve into the other environments within 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The historic city of Lancaster itself possesses two thriving universities with a medical school, renowned secondary education at both the Lancaster Royal Grammar School and the Lancaster Girls Grammar School and a city with a vibrant, multi-cultural way of life. The local area offers choice and for those keen to maintain ties further afield, the city is just two and a half hours from London and Glasgow by direct rail transfer and just one hour\u2019s drive from Manchester and Liverpool, with all these destinations offering international travel options.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This new Consultant post is based at the Royal Lancaster Infirmary, which is in the center of the City.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our department has a workload to keep you interested and challenged, but still give you time to talk to your patients properly, and undertake the practical procedures that interest you as an Acute Frailty Consultant, which will enhance patient care. The department is staffed with a good skill mix of Consultants, SAS Doctors and Junior Doctors, working closely with the strong nursing team including an evolving team of Advanced Nurse Practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This post is available at Full Time (10PA&#39;s) up to a maximum of 12PA&#39;s, or Part Time by negotiation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In addition, UHMBT has a keen interest and extensive involvement in Medical and Dental Education at both Undergraduate and Postgraduate levels. We work in partnership with Lancaster Medical School, and Health Education North West to provide quality education and training which meets the requirements of these regulatory bodies as well as the Trust\u2019s high standards of patient care. We are the lead NHS organisation and take responsibility throughout the five years of the degree for the provision of acute practice placements and medical students from Lancaster Medical School spend time on attachment to the department.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is an excellent opportunity for the right candidate to support the further development of Acute Frailty Care in this area.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are open to accommodating individuals who may be interested in a dual post with another specialty, as we are a forward-thinking organisation that appreciates that there is much benefit from having clinicians with experience from multiple specialties, so that clinical strengths are shared and there is cross-over of skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We will offer an attractive relocation package for the right candidate.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Interview expenses will be paid from point of entry to the UK.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You must either be on the GMC Specialist Register with a license to practice in Geriatric Medicine or be within six months of obtaining your CCT award (or equivalent) at the time of interview.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Interview date; TBA&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;- interviews will be virtual via Microsoft Team Meetings&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For further details / informal visits contact:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;NameDr Mark TaylorJob titleClinical LeadEmail addressMark.Taylor@mbht.nhs.ukAdditional contact information&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=121712"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Royal Lancaster Infirmary, Lancaster", "postalCode": "LA1 4RP"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "54.0429", "longitude": "-2.79902"}}, "title": "Consultant Acute Geriatrician", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916254871", "validThrough": "2020-11-24T23:59:59+0000"}

Our sonographers practice with a team of assistants and clerical staff, and have an enthusiastic team of radiologists who are available to offer advice and support.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The successful candidate will need to be a qualified sonographer holding a DMU or Post Graduate Diploma in Medical Ultrasound, or equivalent, with appropriate registration (HPC if a radiographer). A significant amount of experience would be ideal, including training ultrasound students. However, newly qualified staff will also be considered at an appropriate pay band.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Scanning in the department is clinically driven, with a commitment to meaningful audit and governance. Professional development and involvement in MDT is encouraged and supported.

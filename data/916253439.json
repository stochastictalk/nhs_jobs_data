We can carry this out at a place closest to you, and there will be no cost to you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Volunteer Drivers are often required to assist patients into and out of the vehicle. There may also be suitcases, walking aids and personal belongings to be carried for patients, therefore Volunteer Drivers need to enjoy general good health and be physically able.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The aim of G4S is to find drivers who are closest to the patient therefore drivers generally undertake local, mid-range requests, and are free to opt in or out of long distance requests .&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tax Free Expense claims:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For this valuable service reimbursement for mileage incurred is currently set by the government at \u00a30.45p/mile with a maximum tax free allowance of 10,000 miles per annum.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example of Earnings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Tax free earnings up to 10,000 miles at \u00a30.45p/mile.

Care outside of the hospital setting is a critical service in the role of the NHS. It is an essential cog that allows the NHS to function successfully. Different services are working closely together, with the aim to reduce hospital admissions and deliver an excellent standard of care to patients within their own home. This is an exciting opportunity to continually develop and learn new skills to meet these needs as the service continuously evolves.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;SWFT is an excellent performing NHS Trust who really cares about their staff.

The pathway consists of three acute mental health wards (assessment, treatment and recovery wards) and a specialist psychiatric intensive care unit (PICU). Our assessment unit also has a contract with the Ministry of Defence (MOD) to deliver an inpatient service to members of the armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The role will entail providing assessments, formulations, brief psychological interventions and group work to individuals admitted to the wards, as well as offering consultation and training to the multidisciplinary teams.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The therapeutic work is diverse, providing an excellent opportunity to develop clinical skills working with a range of mental health needs. There are also opportunities to develop your practice in supporting multidisciplinary teams to think psychologically through the delivery of reflective practice and team formulation sessions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Service development and evaluation initiatives are welcomed. Psychological input is valued by the multidisciplinary teams as part of holistic care and you will need to demonstrate creativity and flexibility in delivering a psychology service across four inpatient wards. It will also be essential to build relationships with psychology and other colleagues within the secondary care mental health services to facilitate transition of care from inpatient services to the community.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The ideal candidate would have experience of working within secondary care adult mental health services and be adept at building relationships to embed psychological knowledge within the teams. Experience of inpatient services is desirable, but not essential.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The post-holder will be supported to deliver the service by a Higher Clinical Assistant Psychologist and will form part of a supportive therapies team, composed of occupational therapists, occupational therapy assistants, a peer support worker and housing officer. They will have access to supervision from a senior psychologist within the trust and be supported by the Directorate Lead for Psychology.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In addition, there are opportunities to connect with adult community psychology colleagues through the monthly North Cambridgeshire Psychology Meetings. There are also strong links and regular meetings with the acute adult inpatient psychologists based in Fulbourn Hospital, Cambridge, to share ideas and service development initiatives. Career and continuing professional development will be supported through the identification of learning / training needs via the appraisal process.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Here at Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust (CPFT) we are dedicated to providing high quality care with compassion. We deliver many of the NHS services that are provided outside of hospital and in the community such as physical, mental health and specialist services.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are a health and social care organisation, offering a wide range of services, including:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Integrated physical and mental health services for adults and older people;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Specialist mental health and learning disability services;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Children and young people\u2019s mental health services;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Children\u2019s community services in Peterborough;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Social care;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ground-breaking research&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We strongly encourage applications from all sections of the community, particularly from under-represented groups including disabled people and members of our BAME and LGBTQ+ communities.

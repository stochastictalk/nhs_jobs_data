It does extraordinary work, both on the frontline of emergency services and at the heart of the NHS across the capital, providing the right urgent care to patients at the right time, and in the most effective way possible. After a challenging period three years ago, the London Ambulance Service is improving rapidly: judged to be a \u201cgood\u201d service by the Care Quality Commission, it is working to harness opportunities to continuously improve in order to provide safe, high-quality, patient-centred care for all who need it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A new role on the board, the Chief Paramedic and Quality Officer will play a pivotal role for LAS. As the voice of paramedics, this person will bring together the quality agenda alongside clinical education and training.

As part of the executive group, they will develop LAS\u2019s culture, modernising ways of working and leading a strong and capable team. The postholder will provide best-in-class leadership to LAS\u2019s quality, clinical education and training agendas, while building effective partnerships internally and externally and ensuring that in every respect the Trust remains at the cutting edge of developments in the sector.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Candidates will be a senior leader who will be immediately comfortable operating at executive leadership level, with experience working as a paramedic. Able to challenge colleagues in a structured and evidence-based way, they will be capable of building strong partnerships with, and influencing, key internal and external stakeholders. Candidates will be able to drive meaningful clinical and cultural change in a fast-paced, demanding and ambiguous environment, and will have the personal resilience and impact to bring together LAS\u2019s quality and governance, training and clinical education agendas.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Saxton Bampfylde Ltd is acting as an employment agency advisor to the London Ambulance Service on this appointment.

We are a partnership of two specialist hospitals which are known throughout the world for our expertise, standard of care and research success.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our upper airway service was established 7 years ago by Dr James Hull, to treat patients with chronic refractory cough, inducible laryngeal obstruction and other laryngeal symptoms, often with no evidence of asthma or other respiratory disease. Since then, our service has grown exponentially, and we have become one of the leading specialist centres in the UK for the assessment and treatment of upper airway disorders, with a thriving multi-disciplinary team at its heart.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Many patients with upper airway disorders have treatment needs that span specialist speech and language therapy (SLT) and respiratory physiotherapy, given the inseparable relationship between laryngeal and respiratory function. This exciting opportunity is open, therefore, to highly specialist SLTs and respiratory physiotherapists, wishing to broaden their skill set and deliver innovative, integrated therapy to patients with upper airway and breathing pattern disorders.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You must have sufficient experience and relevant specialist knowledge for this Band 7 role and a clear commitment to upper airway and breathing pattern work. Working alongside highly regarded respiratory physicians, ENT consultants, specialist therapists, nurses and clinical psychologist, you will assist in consultant-led clinics and have the opportunity to develop new ways of delivering therapy, particularly given the changes in practice resulting from Covid-19. The Trust is very supportive of continuing professional development and regular clinical supervision will be provided.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Should you require any further information regarding this post please contact &lt;strong&gt;Dr Julia Selby, Consultant Speech and Language Therapist&lt;/strong&gt; on j.selby@rbht.nhs.ukor 0207 352 8395.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Closing Date: 18th November 2020&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Due to the popularity of some positions, we reserve the right to close the vacancies early on receipt of sufficient applicants.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You are providing your personal information to the Royal Brompton &amp; Harefield NHS Foundation Trust for the purposes of staff administration; administration of membership records (Foundation Trust Membership); crime prevention &amp; prosecution of offenders; National Fraud initiative and occupational health purposes and by applying &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;for this post you hereby consent to the Trust processing of your personal data as outlined above. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/121402.jpg", "name": "Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=121402"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Royal Brompton Hospital", "postalCode": "SW3 6NP"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "51.4897", "longitude": "-.170831"}}, "title": "Highly Specialist Upper Airway Therapist", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916247317", "validThrough": "2020-11-18T23:59:59+0000"}

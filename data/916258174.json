Public Health England and many of its employees will be in scope for transition to new organisations in Spring 2021. Any new or current employees working for Public Health England during this time, will receive appropriate communications and consultation prior to any formal transfer taking place.\u00a0 Employees who compulsorily transfer to successor bodies will remain on their existing contractual terms and conditions and this applies both to current employees and those recruited during the transition.\u00a0 The recruitment, growth &amp; development of our workforce is vital for the continuing success of PHE and the\u00a0future National Institute for Health Protection.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Multiple exciting opportunities have arisen for an experienced scientist to support the evaluation of immune responses to existing and novel vaccines, with specific focus on Group B Streptococcus and SARS-CoV-2. Two positions will sit within the Pathogen Immunology Group and one within the Immunoassay Group, all based at Public Health England, Porton Down. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The post requires a graduate level scientist with additional lab experience who would be prepared to support various projects within each of the two groups. This work will involve working closely with the Project Team Leaders and other scientists within the groups to ensure that the objectives of the projects are met within the required timelines. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Candidates should have experience performing immunological assays and/or expertise in protein purification techniques. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Experience of working at ACDP Containment Level 2 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;and knowledge of immunology and vaccines is essential. For one of the positions previous experience of working to quality systems (e.g. GXP and ISO 9001) is desirable. Successful applicants will be able to demonstrate a high level of attention to detail with the ability to follow written procedures and accurately record results. They will be adaptable and flexible, proactive and highly organised with the ability to work both independently and as part of a team, and have excellent writing and presentation skills&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Please note this is not a biomedical scientist post and is therefore not suitable for completing an IBMS registration training portfolio.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Option 3 \u2013 External&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Open to all external applicants (anyone) from outside the Civil Service (including by definition internal applicants).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Appointment to this post is on PHE terms and conditions of service.

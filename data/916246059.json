We are expanding the service to take referrals for people up to the age of 64 and this has created an exciting opportunity for additional staffing across the service. With bases in Worcester and Bromsgrove, we are a countywide service helping individuals and their families to cope with psychosis, promoting recovery, reducing trauma and tackling stigma.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are seeking two full time Band 3 Support Workers (North and South) to join our Worcestershire Early Intervention Psychosis Team. We value applicants who have a lived experience of mental illness and can offer a unique perspective in offering support for service users through various stages of their recovery. This includes working with the other team members and organisations to achieve the best outcomes for service users and their families. In addition to working with service users individually, the role includes collaboratively planning, delivering and evaluating of groups and family work. As a team we aim to promote independence, health and well-being and social inclusion for service users through advice and practical support to engage in their local community individually or as part of a group.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Worcestershire\u2019s Early Intervention Service is an award-winning service with an international reputation.

It\u2019s the moment when they realise they\u2019ve made a small, but important, step forward. Very often, that small step is the start of something bigger. But only when the right support, advice and services are in place. That\u2019s where you come in, working as part of Turning Point to deliver our highly successful and innovative \u2018Improving Access to Psychological Therapies\u2019 (IAPT) delivery model.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Turning Point has exciting new opportunities in our new service in Luton for experienced CBT\u2019s. This is a growing service, and as such we will be recruiting for all roles over the next 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In return, you\u2019ll enjoy the scope and support to enhance your own life and career too, as you gain the experience and training you need to progress in your career with us. You will also be able to make use of our digital platform to work remotely where available.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We support people who are having difficulty in coping and who may be suffering from a common mental illness such as depression, anxiety or phobias. Our approach embeds the notion of well\u2013being and recovery and promotes personal responsibility for lifestyle choices and self\u2013management of mental well\u2013being. For our clients, this has resulted in a highly accessible and user\u2013friendly service available across a wide geographical area.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Service in Luton will provide person-centred, holistic, and accessible wellbeing services which are flexible and creative, easy to access and navigate and responsive to the needs of local people. It will enhance and protect the health and wellbeing of the population of Luton and improve the health of the poorest fastest.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The service will contribute to tackling inequalities in health through promoting and supporting people to develop healthier behaviours and lifestyles in the context of their own local communities. It focuses on engaging with individuals in communities and offering them practical support to change their behaviour to achieve their own choices and goals and achieve greater personal resilience stability.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are now looking to recruit High Intensity CBT Therapists, with a qualification in Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and BABCP accreditation, or HCPC registered Clinical or Counselling Psychologists with strong CBT training and experience who are BABCP accredited or eligible for accreditation. Alongside extensive experience of working within Mental Health, you\u2019ll have a proven ability to develop good therapeutic relationships with clients and working relationships with your colleagues. You\u2019ll manage your own caseload working towards both service and individual targets, having an IAPT Supervision Course under your belt would be helpful too\u2013 but not essential. Excellent opportunities for both CPD and clinical innovation are available within the service.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you\u2019re inspired by the social model of mental health that works holistically according to need rather than diagnosis and would like to help us achieve our vision, we can offer a competitive remuneration package and excellent training and development opportunities.

Almroth Wright and Rodney Porter wards are established busy 15 and 8 single room Gastroenterology and Endocrine wards. We are steadily building our nursing team and require committed Band 5 nurses to complete the establishment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;These wards care for patients with a range of needs often with multiple conditions, meaning the work is often challenging but always rewarding. We have an establishment of a ward matron and six charge nurses to lead the team. We work closely with the Upper GI, Lower GI and specialist nurses, members of the multi-disciplinary support team and consultants. We pride ourselves on working closely with relatives and carers, the discharge team and the community to ensure that our patients\u2019 needs are met on discharge.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There are opportunities for you to develop and gain skills in the speciality as well as gaining management experience under the guidance of our senior nurse team. You will be offered opportunities to attend study days to learn more about patient conditions such as diabetes and for newly qualified nurses we have a preceptorship programme. We are also keen to develop nursing students of the future and work closely with Kings University and Bucks University to mentor students on placement.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We recognise the great work our nurses do and have already rewarded our nurses through the Trust\u2019s Make a Difference campaign. We are keen to employ nurses who want to develop their skills and deliver high quality care to our patients and support the patient experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Trust reserves the right to close this vacancy prior to the closing date should we receive 50 applications prior to the advertised closing date. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\u201cWe are committed to equal opportunities and improving the working lives of our staff and will consider applications to work flexibly, part-time or job share.

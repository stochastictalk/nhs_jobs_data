Living with a chronic illness and adjusting to the changes that define the disease require coping strategies and skills, and ongoing emotional support. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Within the current case load of patients there are a significant number of identified and documented psychological issues. Due to the nature of the conditions it is expected that all children on the case load will experience mental health issues as some point. This is currently an unmet need and the postholder will develop an integrated service for children and young people under the care of the Leeds Neuromuscular team, including those transitioning to adult services.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The job will predominantly outpatient based, although some Children and young people with Neuromuscular disorders may require support to manage psychological and emotional distress during an admission to Leeds Children\u2019s Hospital. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It is envisaged that the postholder will see patients in both clinic and community settings, whichever is deemed the most appropriate setting for assessment and/or intervention. They will be supported in these activities by other members of the Neuromuscular MDT and maintain professional links with the child &amp; adolescent mental health service &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For more information contact Dr Karen Pysden &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Consultant Paediatric Neurologist or Katie Ward Children\u2019s Neuromuscular Nurse specialist 07585985340&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/122272.jpg", "name": "Leeds Children's Hospital", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=122272"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "The Leeds General Infirmary", "postalCode": "LS1 3EX"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "53.8015", "longitude": "-1.55175"}}, "title": "Clinical Nurse Specialist Liaison Mental Health (XR06)", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916248030", "validThrough": "2020-11-19T23:59:59+0000"}

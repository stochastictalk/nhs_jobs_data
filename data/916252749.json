Your training and education is our priority. Our nurses benefit from having a full-time lead educator to support clinical facilitators and we actively encourage post-graduate funding applications.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Our neonatal service is the largest neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) service within north west London. As the pioneering UK-wide centre for therapeutic hypothermia neonates we treat more than 1000 babies per year from all over the country at risk from irreversible brain injury. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Our neonatal unit provides care to high risk, critically ill neonates, and integrating the family into care is one of our guiding principles. Our NICU service has recently launched an integrated family-centred care project (based on a model from Toronto Children\u2019s Hospital) which supports parents in becoming equal members of the neonatal team and participating in providing active care for their baby with the help of competency based training.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We will enable you to develop confidence and skills through a wide range of opportunities as you develop your career as a neonatal nurse. You will benefit from the support of a team of onsite education nurses, a lead risk nurse for children\u2019s services and two full-time community discharge nurses. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition, we can support you through MSc/post graduate pathways and advanced leadership training with coaching to continue your development as a leader within your chosen specialty.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Trust reserves the right to close this vacancy prior to the closing date should we receive 50 applications prior to the advertised closing date.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;We are committed to equal opportunities and improving the working lives of our staff and will consider applications to work flexibly, part-time or job share.

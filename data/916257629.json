Their activities support the delivery of HEE objectives and priorities as described in our Mandate and the HEE workforce plan: \u201cFramework 15\u201d. They are also ideally placed to work within the NHS\u2019s newly emerging system architecture and support the delivery of the NHS\u2019 Long Term Plan.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Currently the priorities, activities and maturity of Training Hubs varies which has proven challenging in ensuring the consistency of activities and the roll out of effective/innovative programmes. However, their potential to develop further is considerable as they are ideally positioned to enable \u201cplace-based\u201d delivery of education, training and workforce development for the wider NHS primary care workforce at undergraduate and postgraduate levels and at all stages of a NHS professional\u2019s career in primary care. We believe that through a \u201cplace-based\u201d approach Training Hubs can positively influence workforce \u201cinvestment decisions\u201d and the delivery of population healthcare needs to help tackle healthcare inequalities.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To assist Training Hubs across the Midlands region develop, reach the required \u201cmaturity\u201d and achieve their new remit, we are looking to expand our Primary Care Team. We are therefore looking to recruit to a number of posts which will provide dedicated, bespoke support to our 11 regional place-based footprints/Training Hubs.

It will also work closely with the colleagues supporting Primary Care within the region\u2019s Workforce Transformation Hub.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The successful postholder will provide a range of flexible administrative support services to ensure the smooth running of the Primary Care School across the region and will be expected to support the team in the effective administration of the Primary Care Long Term Plan, Mandate and People Plan deliverables ensuring deadlines are met and that activities are planned in a timely and effective manner.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The postholder will be an experienced Administrator with proven experience of:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Providing secretariat for a range of key meetings associated with the programme&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Planning and co-ordinating meetings and events&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Acting as the first point of contact for all diary management and travel arrangements&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This post can be based in either of HEE\u2019s Midlands regional offices i.e. Birmingham or Leicester.

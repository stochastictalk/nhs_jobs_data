The successful candidate would be expected to contribute actively to this ongoing aspect of service development.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Acute Service provides a comprehensive range of in- and out-patient Services to a catchment population of 310,000 including an established Ambulatory Care Service. All acute services are highly valued by patients, hospital and GP colleagues. The consultants have clinical leadership roles in different sub-speciality areas and each is tasked to further develop their allocated service areas.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Approximately 20,000 patients are assessed annually (i.e. about 70 per day) with a wide spectrum of acute unselected medical problems.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The unit consist of 2 wards (male and female) and has a total of 40 beds. More than half of the beds have cardiac monitors. All patients are seen on a daily basis by consultants 7 days a week with support of a junior team. Typically the patients are split between 3 consultants allowing enough time to be dedicated to each patient.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For weekends the arrangements are slightly different, but all patients will be seen by a senior decision maker over the weekend as well. The dedicated team of junior doctors on AMU will consist of 1 SPR, 5 middle grades doctors, 2 ACCS trainees 5 FY2s, 1 Trust doctor and 1 FY1. Two experienced Nurse Practitioners also contribute to the day to day running of the ambulatory care unit.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The 2 AMUs have the services of phlebotomists, including Saturday and Sunday mornings.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There are 7 day imaging services available including MRI.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In-reach speciality services are available 5 days a week for all services and reduced services for agreed pathways over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ambulatory Care Unit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our quickly expanding Ambulatory Care Unit is now seeing over 1200 patients per month and is co-located with one of our AMUs with its own waiting area, assessment room, special examination chairs, trolleys and beds (a total of 16 chairs, trolleys and beds).

All GP-referred patients are screened via the Ambulatory Care Unit as well as all clinic admissions and patients referred from ED suitable for the service. It is expected that this service will continue to expand very fast and more senior input from consultants will be required. The service is running 7 days a week.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The AMU consultants will cover the medical take Monday to Friday until 5pm with junior doctors from General Medicine. After 5pm an on-call consultant will be responsible for the medical take. The AMU consultant will only be responsible after 5pm when on-call which is roughly 1 in 30 for weekdays. On weekends the medical take is run by General Medicine and the AMU consultants are responsible only for the AMU and Ambulatory Care (1 in 8 weekends).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The appointee is anticipated to develop a hot rheumatology service attached to the ambulatory care unit.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a University Teaching Hospital Trust linked with the University College London we value teaching and audit skills and emphasise the role of Clinical Governance in everyday clinical practice.

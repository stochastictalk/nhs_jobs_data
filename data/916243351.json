This has helped us to build a national reputation for high quality health and social care services and helped us to become one of just 50 vanguard sites across the country. The Care Quality Commission (CQC) rated Salford Care Organisation as an outstanding organisation following an inspection in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You will also undertake responsibility for managing specific aspects of practice in the absence of the Principle Manager and provide assessment and support to staff taking student social workers on placement with the Directorate as well as taking lead responsibility within their team for students.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You will be responsible for carrying out social work duties and will carry an appropriate case load in relation to the most complex cases requiring the highest levels of skills, knowledge and professional expertise.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Salford is an exciting place to work and live.

It is a busy service which provides care for patients with short term care requirements, exacerbation of long term conditions, and end of life nursing needs. The team can provide you with an excellent opportunity to learn and develop holistic nursing skills with colleagues who are committed to community nursing and delivering care closer to home.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;District Nursing is a great opportunity for you if you are a compassionate, enthusiastic and highly motivated nurse who is interested in working in a community setting and has an intention to develop clinical and leadership skills. You will take part in the effective delivery of treatment and care, and you must be committed to maintaining high standards, and have the drive to want to make a difference to patient care. In return for your commitment and talent we can offer a supportive work environment and the opportunity to develop your career in this interesting environment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For recently qualified Nurse Associates the trust has a robust preceptorship programme and you will receive excellent opportunities for development.

The town has excellent road and rail links, and easy access to several airports.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Rotherham borough has a population of approximately 250,000 and covers approximately 100 square miles. Traditional heavy industries have been replaced by hi-tech industries and a thriving service sector. One legacy of the town\u2019s industrial heritage is that the borough is made up of many villages (some very small and picturesque) separated by farm and common land.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Rotherham has a number of very pleasant suburbs and the hospital itself is located in attractive leafy urban surroundings approximately two miles from the award-winning town centre. Housing in the Rotherham area is competitively priced and offers a wide range of choice, including urban and rural locations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Within Rotherham, there are three country parks, an English Heritage Site and the nationally acclaimed Magna Science Adventure Centre, which draws on Rotherham\u2019s industrial past to provide a spectacular and educational experience. A \u201cGulliver\u2019s Kingdom\u201d theme park is currently being planned for the town. The historic Wentworth Woodhouse, with its spectacular monuments, beautiful parkland and 365 rooms is also situated within the borough.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There are several high-performing state schools in Rotherham. Coaches also run from Rotherham to excellent private schools in Sheffield.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Consultant Obstetrician &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are pleased to offer the opportunity for an enthusiastic Obstetrician with well-rounded training to join an existing team of 11 Consultants.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Obstetric unit conducts approximately 2500 deliveries per year,&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Maternity Unit currently has 23 beds and a Level 2 Neonatal Unit.

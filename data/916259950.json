Our SHCAs are able to spend long periods of time with the patient and family so really get to know the issues and help to provide the solutions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Whilst our focus is the patient who wishes to die at home, we provide support and advice to the whole family, giving an opportunity to deliver holistic care to the whole household. The hospice at home team visited 440 patients at home last year, they provided symptom control, emotional, psychological and spiritual support whilst also providing hands on care.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The successful candidates would need to have significant experience in caring and have a QCF level 3 in Health and Social Care or the equivalent and be passionate about providing good quality palliative care to people in their own homes. They would need to have excellent communication skills, work well on their own but also work within a very supportive team.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The postholders would be working shifts to cover 7 days a week.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For an informal discussion, please contact Karenne Weaver (Hospice at Manager) on 01803 217638 or Victoria Bartlett (Deputy Director of Patient Care) on 01803 217428.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Previous applications need not apply&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Closing date: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a029th November 2020&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interview date: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a08th December 2020&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;\u2018My wife was treated as a&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;person, not a patient\u2019&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mr A 2020&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rowcroft Hospice is an Equal Opportunities Employer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Rowcroft Hospice \u2013 Rowcroft House Foundation Ltd&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Registered Charity No. 282723&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Rowcroft Hospice", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=131434"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Torquay", "postalCode": "TQ2 5LS"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "50.4701", "longitude": "-3.54792"}}, "title": "Hospice at Home Senior Healthcare Assistant", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916259950", "validThrough": "2020-11-29T23:59:59+0000"}

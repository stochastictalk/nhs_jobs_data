The hospital has recently expanded intensive care capacity and now has two Intensive Care Units (9 &amp; 5 Level-3 beds) and two High Dependency Units (9 &amp; 4 Level-2 beds), providing care for neurology and neurosurgical patients, in one of the largest dedicated neurocritical care facilities in the UK. The post involves the management of critical care patients with both neurosurgical and neurological conditions. There is excellent senior support 24/7 for the unit with two daily ward rounds by ICU consultants and a dedicated anaesthetist to help with airway management and other out-of-hours intensive care issues. There may be opportunities to rotate to other intensive care units within the University College London NHS Foundation Trust hospitals. There are opportunities for audit, clinical research and quality improvement projects, as well as developing technical skills and competencies in Critical Care Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There is a weekly formal educational programme, consisting of consultant/senior delivered teaching twice a week, journal club and informal bedside teaching.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Applicants must hold full registration with the GMC and must have successfully completed foundation year 2 training &lt;strong&gt;in UK &lt;/strong&gt;NHS hospitals.

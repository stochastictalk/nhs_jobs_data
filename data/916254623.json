We are one of the busiest in the region, serving a diverse local population. We are part of the East of England Trauma Network, but as a designated Trauma Unit in a unique location we still manage a large amount of trauma. The hospital is the regional stroke centre, and we have access to a full range of specialty support.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our department underwent a recent refurbishment and there are plans for a major site redevelopment, providing exciting opportunities for further enhancing our service.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Come and join us in shaping the future of Emergency Care in a Major Centre.

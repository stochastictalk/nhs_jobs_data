The Child and Family Team has a focus on those under the age of 14 predominantly, however the post holder will work with young people up to 25 within the Family Therapy role.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Child and Family Team shares close links with the Youth Service, who support individuals between the ages of 14 and 25; the Early Intervention Team, who support individuals with first episode psychosis; the Eating Disorder Service and the Tier four inpatient adolescent Unit, which offers inpatient care to young people under the age of 18.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are looking for a Systemic Family Therapist to join the Child &amp; Family Team. The position will be based in Great Yarmouth but provide clinical input to children, young people and families in Waveney. Alongside individual work, the post holder will coordinate and be a part of the locality screen teams for Family Therapy, provide supervision and support with the strategic vision for Family Therapy (see below).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You will have:-&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A Masters Qualification in Systemic Psychotherapy and be registered with the HCPC or UKCP.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Relevant experience of working as a Systemic Family Therapist and treatment of clients across a range of settings.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience of working in multi-disciplinary teams with a variety of client groups.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Able to work effectively in a team setting with excellent communication and ICT skills.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Strategic Vision&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As well as the details outlined in relation to the role of the family therapist as stated above, we thought that it may be helpful for those applying for this post to have an idea of the wider strategic vision for family therapy across Norfolk and Waveney\u2019s Child, Family &amp; Young Persons services (CFYP).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Importantly, following previous recruitment difficulties to family therapy, this exciting new post sits within a wider service plan for family therapy. Fundamentally, this plan is being strategically supported by the care group, &lt;em&gt;i.e. the leadership team for Norfolk and Waveney\u2019s CFYP Services.&lt;/em&gt; Recent improvements have overseen the development of systemic practitioner posts across the service line, as well as 6 systemic psychotherapy training posts with these employee\u2019s currently undertaking their MSc in systemic psychotherapy. In addition, three senior clinicians are being supported to undertake systemic supervision training to help ensure that adequate clinical and professional governance is in place for family therapy as a profession moving forwards.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Although there have been some recent challenges in relation to coronavirus, NSFT also run courses in family therapy at Foundation &amp; Intermediate levels, as well as a multiagency course in systemic supervision for managers and senior clinicians. We have also been working with the University of East Anglia to develop a local MSc in systemic psychotherapy and although the development of this course has currently been put on hold, this is generally seen as a positive next step for the family therapy locally, with everything in place for this to again be reconsidered in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In terms of face-to-face clinical practice with families, whilst some adjustments have had to be made in response to coronavirus, there is widespread use of a family therapy team approach across the CFYP service line. This is recognised as an important model, both in terms of mental health service provision for families, as well as providing huge opportunity for workforce development. I hope that the above paragraph provides a wider context in terms of NSFT\u2019s relationship to family therapy as a profession if you wish to ask any more about this, please feel free to do so via the contact numbers provided.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For further details / informal visits contact:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;NameEllie VarneyJob titleCommunity Team ManagerTelephone number01493 337601&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/121326.png", "name": "Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=121326"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Northgate Hospital, Great Yarmouth", "postalCode": "NR30 1BU"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "52.6176", "longitude": "1.7286"}}, "title": "Systemic Family Therapist", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916254456", "validThrough": "2020-11-19T23:59:59+0000"}

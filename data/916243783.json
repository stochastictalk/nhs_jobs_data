These units are dedicated in providing care for seriously ill patients from across a range of medical and surgical specialties. Having two Intensive Care Units means we can separate the care we offer to our patients. Recently we opened the new unit for COVID-19 patients which is one of the most sophisticated units in the region. The 14 beds in Pierce Intensive Care Unit is contained in a negative pressure environment, having sealed areas with carefully controlled ventilation that prevents contaminated air from escaping the room which maximises safety for staff and patients. We are privileged to have two units enabling us to separate the care we can offer to our patients.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our Band 5 pathway includes:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Supernumerary period (including induction)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Progression through the nationally recognised \u2018Critical Care Steps\u2019 Competency Framework&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Mentorship and support&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Opportunities for further Critical Care academic courses and further development&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Flexible working conditions/ Part time hours&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your future Career&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Choosing a career in Critical Care nursing will open many doors for you.

Chesterfield Royal Hospital Emergency Department sees approximately 85,000 new patients every year and this figure is ever growing. We see and treat adults and children of all ages, from walk in minor injuries to ambulance patients.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A team of Sisters/Charge Nurses support the Matron to deliver high quality, fast paced care to our local population. We have 2 clinical educators dedicated to supporting and training new and existing ED staff and a Paediatric Sister who can support adult trained nurses to care for children of all ages.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We are a friendly team made up of a variety of different workforces including Registered nurses (adult and children), Healthcare Assistants, Medicines Administration Pharmacy Technicians, Phlebotomists and Emergency Department Assistants. The department is committed to providing ongoing training and development for staff as appropriate to their existing skills and experience. We offer many \u2018in-house\u2019 courses such as Trauma Immediate Life support, major incident and CBRN training, Paediatric Life support, Recognising ECG rhythm\u2019s, Understanding and undertaking arterial blood gases, IV cannulation and venepuncture as well as many advanced skills such as Adult advanced life support and paediatric advanced life support. Our band 5 competency packages allow progressive movement to senior staff nurse status.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Our team also consists of Emergency Nurse Practitioners who see, treat and discharge their own patients. We are committed to developing all staff into the role they wish to aspire to and each year train a new member of staff to become an advanced practitioner.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We are currently working on plans for an exciting Urgent Care Village; this will see the footprint of the department grow extensively with purpose built facilities for patients and staff.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Our robust induction plan ensures you get an insight not only into the several areas of the department you will be working in but also with members of the MDT such as East Midlands Ambulance Service, Mental health liaison team and Plaster Clinic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Since COVID-19 we have split our department into three working areas Green Majors; Red zone and Ambulatory majors and minors. This has significantly increased our footprint and we are looking to recruit Registered Nurses to join our dynamic, caring and professional team. Our separate GP streaming service has 3 clinical treatment rooms and an assessment room.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For further details / informal visits contact:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Matron Kaye Smedley on 01246 512960 or email kayesmedley@nhs.net&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Senior Matron Jane Parkin on 01246 513964 or email jane.parkin3@nhs.net&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We look forward to hearing from you&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/124072.jpg", "name": "Chesterfield Royal Hospital NHS Foundation Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=124072"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Chesterfield Royal Hospital, Chesterfield", "postalCode": "S44 5BL"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "53.2362", "longitude": "-1.40008"}}, "title": "Staff Nurse", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916256791", "validThrough": "2020-11-19T23:59:59+0000"}

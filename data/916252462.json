You will need strong project and programme management skills backed up by effective interpersonal skills, be able to work well with clinical and managerial leads, patients and service users and be capable of leading the development and implementation of innovative planned care and cancer strategies. Equally, you will need to be fully conversant with national operational standards for planned and cancer care and have a good grasp of current national elective care policy, especially in relation to the COVID-19 related recovery and restoration agenda.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you would like an informal conversation about the role, please get in touch with Nikki Brooker by emailing &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;n.brooker@nhs.net&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; who will arrange for an informal chat via telephone with Kevin Wilcox, Head of Planned Care &amp; Cancer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Interviews are expected to take place during the week commencing 23rd November.&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Sussex NHS Commissioners", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=128794"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Hove", "postalCode": "BN12 6BT"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "50.8175", "longitude": "-.411487"}}, "title": "Assistant Head of Planned Care", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916252462", "validThrough": "2020-11-15T23:59:59+0000"}

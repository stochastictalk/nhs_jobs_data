We have moved exclusively to providing evidence-based therapeutic interventions remotely, using approved technology. All staff are being provided with the correct equipment to work remotely in this current climate. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We recognise that, during these uncertain times, staff have had to adapt to new ways of working and managing their well-being. As a service we are committed to supporting staff with this by holding daily huddles to check on well-being, increasing our supervision provision and ensuring the appropriate assessments have been completed to enable people to work safely. We are also utilising technology to ensure that teams are remaining connected during these uniquely challenging times.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For further details / informal visits contact:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;James Walton, IAPT Team Manager - 01423 852137&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;James.walton2@nhs.net&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/122252.jpg", "name": "Tees, Esk and Wear Valleys NHS Foundation Trust ", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=122252"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Valley Gardens Resource Centre, Windsor House, Harrogate", "postalCode": "HG1 2PW"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "53.993", "longitude": "-1.55098"}}, "title": "IAPT Psychological Wellbeing Practitioner", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916242461", "validThrough": "2020-11-16T23:59:59+0000"}

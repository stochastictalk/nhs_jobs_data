The work is varied and interesting with the opportunity to be part of redesigning services for the local population served by the CrESH system.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This post attracts a High Cost Area Supplement of 5% of the basic salary subject to a minimum and maximum payment per annum (pro rata where applicable) in line with Agenda for Change.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a full time post.

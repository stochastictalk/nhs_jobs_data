The locality has the lowest percentage of unemployment at 3.7% but the highest proportion of those claiming out-of-work benefits. There are several areas of deprivation within the locality, notably in Newport (Pan) with some of the highest figures on the Island for children living in poverty. At the same time, other parts of the locality such as the towns of Brighstone, Calbourne, Gurnard, and parts of Carisbrooke, Northwood and Cowes are among the least deprived.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Its population profile mirrors that of the Island, but this varies considerably across the locality, with areas of the West Wight having an older population profile compared to, for example, parts of Newport in particular Pan. Perhaps surprisingly given its population profile, the locality has the lowest number of residents with a long-term illness or disability (21.7%).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Within our network, we share approximately 43,000 patients and although each of our practices has its own unique identity, by working together we strive to provide the best possible patient care.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;North East Locality&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The North East Locality comprises six practices:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Tower House Surgery, Ryde&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The Esplanade Surgery, Ryde&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Argyll\u00a0House Surgery, Ryde&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;East Cowes\u00a0Medical Centre&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;St Helen&#39;s Surgery, St Helen\u2019s&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Medina Healthcare, Wootton Bridge&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The North East PCN covers approximately 19% of the Isle of Wight\u2019s total area and a population of 53,342 making it the most densely populated locality. The area offers a mix of urban and rural areas including the major gateway towns of Ryde and East Cowes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Its population profile mirrors that of the wider population, with a higher proportion of older people.\u00a0 Around 22.5% of people living in the North West Locality have a long-term illness or disability. The locality also has the highest rate of unemployment at 4.83% and contains several areas of deprivation but, conversely, parts of the area are also home to many second homeowners. This population profile presents a varied opportunity for healthcare professionals seeking new roles and all within easy commuting distance from the mainland or for those considering a move to the Island.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The network is well resourced both in terms of GPs and a wide range of different practitioners operating within and across the practices including Advanced Nurse Practitioners and shared roles like Paramedics, providing a patient visiting service, and Clinical Pharmacists.\u00a0 The practices also share flu clinics in the Ryde area and phlebotomy services and work to empower patients and their carers to improve their physical and mental wellbeing&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Together the practices within the network have embraced innovation, working on a number of initiatives to improve patient care including setting up the first Primary Care Mental Health practitioner model on the Island.\u00a0 This involves mental health practitioners working in practice to support patients, working in partnership with secondary care and with peer support from the Isorropia Foundation \u2013 a specialist mental health community interest company working on the Island.\u00a0 The initiative has been a great success for patients and professionals alike and is now being rolled out across the Island.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The member practices within the network work as a cohesive team to provide high quality medical services for their local community and together share learning and provide mutual support.\u00a0 They work collaboratively with neighbouring networks and with other health partners to deliver holistic services based around the needs of the community and individual patients.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Dr Jo Hesse, Clinical Director said: \u201cWe are a vibrant and varied group of practices that work together to better the services we offer our patients, and to support each other.

This post is to start in August 2021 for the duration of one year.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This fellowship post would suit applicants who have nearly completed a recognised anaesthetic specialist training programme, including someone who already possesses a CCT in anaesthesia. The post offers the opportunity to develop and increase anaesthetic experience in regional anaesthesia, prior to taking up a consultant post. The level of supervision will be tailored to the fellow\u2019s prior experience with the ultimate aim of independent practice with distant supervision, so to work at junior consultant level with senior consultant support. The fellow would participate in an on call rota on a 1:8 frequency.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The NHS department enjoys close links with the University Of Cambridge Department Of Anaesthesia and there are opportunities for the Subspecialty Fellow to become involved in research and other forms of career development as appropriate to the individual. It is expected that the Fellow will play an active role in non-clinical activities in their specialty of interest as part of their professional development, and will be assigned an educational supervisor who will regularly review these.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust comprises Addenbrooke\u2019s and The Rosie Hospital and is a thriving, modern NHS hospital based in Cambridge, England. It is the Major Trauma Centre for the East of England.

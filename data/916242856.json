We are seeking motivated individuals with a keen interest and experience in working with these children and young people. Your development will be supported through required training, CPD events and regular clinical supervision as well as informal support from colleagues within the team. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You will be given the opportunity to work as part of a multidisciplinary team including Paediatricians, Speech and language Therapy, Psychiatry, Nursery Nursing and Occupational Therapy. This is a dynamic role where you may be working within community settings such as schools, clinics and family homes. The post involves assessment and intervention for children and young people with Autism, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) with their emotional and psychological needs and contributing to their diagnoses.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is an exciting opportunity for you to be part of this development process in a service which has been rated as outstanding for being caring by the CQC. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This will be a development role with progression from a Band 7 to a band 8a role upon successful completion of a preceptorship programme. It is expected that this will be achievable within a period of up to two years and will be dependent on the experience of the successful candidate. In the event that elements of the preceptorship programme are not fully met the role will remain as a band 7. This will be further discussed as part of the interview process and with the preferred candidate as appropriate. Applications from newly qualified/soon to qualify clinicians would be welcomed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As travel is an integral part of this post, car owner/driver, or suitable alternative transport to enable you to undertake the job is essential (It is unlikely that public transport will meet this requirement).

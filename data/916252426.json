The jewel in the crown of its historic past is its Norman castle, built on Roman foundations. A wealth of new homes is complemented by an equally broad selection of character homes in the plethora of picture-postcards villages that surround the town. The likes of Sible Hedingham, Finchingfield and Dedham (the latter being the heart of Constable Country made famous by the artist John Constable) are much sought-after location. Within a stone\u2019s throw of Colchester you have 60kms of beautiful coastline including Blue Flag beaches, the gentile charm of Frinton and the more bustling Clacton \u2013 one of the driest places to live in the UK! \u00a0In addition North Essex boasts several nationally acclaimed schools, including Colchester Royal Grammar School and Colchester County High School for Girls. London Stansted Airport is less than an hour\u2019s drive away while all the attractions of London itself are within easy reach. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Anglian Community Enterprise (CIC)", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=125574"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Colchester", "postalCode": "CO4 5HG"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "51.9184", "longitude": ".896236"}}, "title": "Senior Physiotherapist, Band 6", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916252426", "validThrough": "2020-11-15T23:59:59+0000"}

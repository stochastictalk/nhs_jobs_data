The contacts can range from requests for general advice and information, assistance with appointments, through to concerns about communication and recent episodes of care.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are now looking to appoint to the post of part-time PALS Officer following the imminent&lt;br /&gt;retirement of the current post-holder. In order to be successful, you will need to have worked in a relevant role in the NHS or a public sector organisation providing health services, and possess experience of working in a patient-facing role. The nature of PALS work means you must have excellent listening and communication skills to ensure the matters, simple or detailed, being raised with you are heard, understood and acted upon, and appropriately and professionally discussed and resolved as far as it is possible to with staff at all levels in the organisation. The ability to think on your feet and problem solve, whilst managing a number of cases or tasks at once, is essential to gaining patient satisfaction in a busy environment, as is the ability to negotiate and influence positive outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;PALS is an open service which means it can be contacted by telephone, email and, when it is safe to do so again in the future, visited in person without an appointment. The need to have calm, patient and thoughtful telephone skills, a good level of writing and data entry skills and the ability to remain professional in sometimes difficult, challenging, and emotive situations are an absolute must, whilst demonstrating the right level of understanding and compassion appropriate for each case.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you have the skills we are looking for and wish to increase or expand your patient-facing experience to help achieve positive outcomes and improved patient experience, we want to hear from you. Please ensure you clearly demonstrate in the supporting statement section of your application how you meet the skillset in the person specification \u2013 this is vital as applications are shortlisted for interview on this basis.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There will be significant interest in this role, so please submit your application as soon as possible as we may close the advert earlier than advertised.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Previous applicants with no NHS/health provider or patient-facing experience do not need to&lt;br /&gt;reapply.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;F&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Regrettably, we are unable to offer informal visits to the service at this time but if you have any questions about the vacancy then please contact:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Mr Darren Langridge-Kemp&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Complaints, PALS and Patient Experience Manager&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;darren.langridgekemp@nhs.net / 07973 828505.&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/120634.jpg", "name": "East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=120634"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Cross-Site - Monday (Eastbourne), Tuesday and Friday (Hastings), Cross site", "postalCode": "BN21 2UD"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "50.787", "longitude": ".271136"}}, "title": "PALS Officer", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916248703", "validThrough": "2020-11-12T23:59:59+0000"}

We\u2019ll be clear from the start: this is a very different kind of nursing. We&#39;re about caring for children and young adults with life-threatening and life-limiting conditions, whether they are with us for a relaxing short break, emergency care or for end of life. .&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So you\u2019re here for good days, bad days and last days and which is why our nurses believe this is quite possibly the most rewarding job in the profession. It\u2019s also a hugely diverse role. You simply don\u2019t know what each day will bring. That\u2019s why a genuinely flexible approach is so important, as well as a combination of excellent clinical skills and a sensitive and compassionate nature.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A background in palliative care would be welcomed, but it\u2019s not essential. Just as long as you\u2019ve at least 12 months post-qualification experience gained in any area \u2013 and you\u2019ve the special qualities we\u2019re looking for \u2013 we\u2019d love to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There\u2019s plenty of training and development on offer, as well as a range of excellent benefits. So if you think you\u2019d thrive within our close-knit multidisciplinary team as you make a positive difference to the lives of children and young people, just click on the apply button below to find out more.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Successful applicants will be required to apply for an Enhanced Disclosure from the Disclosure and Barring Service (formerly Criminal Records Bureau).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are an Equal Opportunities employer, welcoming applications from all sections of the community.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We offer a competitive salary, enhancements for unsocial hours, 28 days holiday, and a pension.

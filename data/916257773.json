Our newly refurbished unit offers 12 inpatient beds including a high dependency room. We also offer day patient and outreach treatment. We are based on the pleasant Ida Darwin hospital grounds in a village called Fulbourn, situated close to the centre of Cambridge.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We view eating disorders, particularly anorexia nervosa as chronic illnesses. While recovery is usual, we know this tends to take a long time. We therefore see the goal of treatment at the Phoenix Centre as helping young people improve the degree to which they can control their illness, rather than be controlled by it. This allows for more &quot;normal&quot; family, social and educational experiences and reduces the risk of young people being &quot;lost&quot; to mainstream life.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The post holder will be responsible for identifying and contributing to the training needs of junior registered and unregistered staff, and ensure that issues of equality, diversity and rights are dealt with in accordance with good practice and legislation. They will ensure that effective communication pathways exist, and that they act within their sphere of responsibility, managing the shift in the absence of the Ward Manager or the designated deputy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For further details / informal visits contact:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simon Paveling, Ward Manager&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;simon.paveling@cpft.nhs.uk / 01223534553&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/121760.JPG", "name": "Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=121760"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Phoenix Centre, Cambridge", "postalCode": "CB21 5EE"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "52.1858", "longitude": ".200772"}}, "title": "Research Nurse", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916257773", "validThrough": "2020-11-19T23:59:59+0000"}

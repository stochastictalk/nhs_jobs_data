Do you want a position where your ideas and creativity in providing patient care are listened to and valued.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Dementia is a growing challenge for communities and we, as healthcare professionals are at the forefront of providing the dignity, support and care that people deserve.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We have great plans and need you to help us bring them to life. We have great facilities and are looking at new and innovative ways of making our patients tie with us a rewarding and inspiring time. Rehabilitation and fostering independence is key to everything we do. There are challenges, it\u2019s not always easy, but our successes are rewarding and each day\u2019s challenges bring something new.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We need people who are creative, enthusiastic and have the compassion needed to provide a nurturing environment for those in our care. It takes people with big hearts to achieve the standards we require and if you feel that you do \u2013 then we\u2019d love to hear from you! Values underpinning the 6 C\u2019s of Nursing and a desire to improve patient care are essential for the post.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is no ordinary ward \u2013 we\u2019ve won over some distressed patients with hat making competitions, invited confused patients to team meetings where they\u2019ve engaged and felt useful. We\u2019ve had tea parties and memory boxes and plan to do much, much more! If you are the type of person who thrives on finding new approaches or has the instinct to resolve issues by \u2018thinking outside the box\u2019 then you\u2019re the person we\u2019re looking for!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Many of us have personal experience of family and friends who are elderly, have dementia, delirium and have periods of confusion. We all wish that their care and the services on offer to support their families, our families, are inspirational and supportive \u2013 that\u2019s what we are working hard to improve! Do you believe you have something special to offer that will improve services while giving you the opportunity to develop your career. This experience will give you invaluable experience while providing a sense of worth often lacking in other areas of nursing. We value the time, effort and energy put in by our people \u2013 and this is a great opportunity to join \u2018Team Amazing!\u2019.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We offer flexible working patterns on a roster basis and a range of employee benefits on NHS terms and conditions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This post is Permanent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hours per week: 37.5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Closing date: 19th November&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2020&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Please be aware that this post requires an Enhanced Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check, the cost of which is payable by the successful candidate.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you have lived or worked abroad for 6 months or more in the last 5 years you will need to obtain an overseas police clearance.

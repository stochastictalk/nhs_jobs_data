This will involve working closely with the local Principal Investigators and the dermatology teams to identify the barriers to recruitment in their centres and to lead in the development of individualised strategies tailored to each centre to help them to overcome these.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The post-holder will be expected to advise and set-up individualised working systems and evaluate these systems to work to the local strengths. The successful candidate will be responsible for a number of centres across the UK and will be required to arrange a visit schedule with each of the participating centres. This will therefore require a significant amount of travelling.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Clinical Research Associate will work closely with the A-STAR Study Manager and will attend the Site Initiation Meetings for centres in the UK. The post holder will have considerable contact with NHS Trusts/hospitals, Local Research Networks, universities and other organisations involved in this research project and therefore a successful candidate will need to demonstrate excellent negotiation and interpersonal skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The successful applicant will have good organisational skills and be able to work both independently and as part of a team, demonstrate a flexible approach to work and meet deadlines using initiative and judgement to prioritise competing demands. In addition, they will have excellent oral and written communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For further details / informal visits contact:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;NameDorothee BoisferJob titleA-STAR Project ManagerEmail addressA-Star@gstt.nhs.ukAdditional contact information&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Due to the current situation with COVID, we will only be able to arrange informal conversations with those people who are shortlisted for the post.&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/121066.jpg", "name": "Guy's and St. Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=121066"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "London", "postalCode": "SE1 9RT"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "51.5046", "longitude": "-.088964"}}, "title": "Clinical Research Associate", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916237805", "validThrough": "2020-11-15T23:59:59+0000"}

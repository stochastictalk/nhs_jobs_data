The Emergency clinic / ward attender appointments are run by the junior doctor team and is a great introduction to ENT out-patient cases.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The dedicated ENT outpatient department has four consulting rooms, and 2 treatment rooms equipped with wall mounted microscopes, rigid and flexible scopes. There is a multi-skills laboratory which includes a dedicated microscope for temporal bone dissection.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Please note this post will not be formally recognised for training but we continue clinical governance half days and education half days to maintain our education programme, and promote a culture of continual improvements.

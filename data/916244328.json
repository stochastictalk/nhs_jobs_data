We are a small community Multi-Disciplinary Team providing expert and intensive rehabilitation in patients\u2019 own homes and community settings on hospital discharge. We are an integral part of the North Cumbria Stroke Pathway developed with the recently set up Hyperacute Stroke Unit at The Cumberland Infirmary (CIC) and the majority of our patients have been in hospital for less than 72 hours. We work closely with the teams at CIC and West Cumberland Hospital, as well as the established Integrated Care Communities (ICCs), to provide a responsive, seamless transition of care from the hospital setting into the community. Our input is designed to be shorter term, to help reduce hospital stays and focussing on supporting patients to achieve their personal goals and return to their normal life as much as possible. The work is varied and rewarding.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Our team currently covers the Copeland and Workington ICC areas, but we are in a period of exciting expansion and are working to extend our service to the Maryport and Cockermouth area as well. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The physiotherapist role includes providing specialist hands on assessment of patients, collaborative goal setting, writing and reviewing treatment plans and supporting non-qualified staff in delivering these. Team therapists currently work office hours, Monday to Friday. You will be working with Occupational Therapists, Speech and Language Therapists and Rehabilitation Assistants, with specialist support from neuro-psychologists when required. The role requires the ability to travel across the Copeland and Workington ICC areas, a high level of flexibility to respond to rapid hospital discharges and excellent time management skills to organise and prioritise work at possibly short notice. You will need to communicate effectively and sensitively with patients and their families, other services and staff of different grades. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Experience of community and neurological rehabilitation are desirable, as is MDT working and working with support staff, but consideration will be given to appropriate transferrable skills.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the year since our establishment, the team has established a great ethos and in our first year we have received extremely positive patient feedback, as well as mentions in the Trust Glimpse of Brilliance and Chief Executive\u2019s blog. We have succeeded in maintaining a high quality service throughout the challenges of COVID-19 and are currently following social distancing guidance, so you will be supported to work part of your hours from home in the medium term, where this is feasible. As a new service we are still developing ways of supporting our communities and you will be involved in thinking creatively about how to meet these challenges going forward.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you have any further enquiries about this post, or would like to arrange a visit to the team, please contact Lou Barratt on 07811714352 or &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;louisa.barratt@ncic.nhs.uk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Healthcare Professionals returning to practice, moving into new roles or changing clinical environments, may access an agreed preceptorship period.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Please ensure that you document evidence of meeting all the essential criteria in the supporting information.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;If sufficient response is received this post could be closed earlier than the specified closing date, please apply as soon as possible to ensure that your application is considered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Trust is committed to safeguarding adults and children therefore if the post is subject to the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act (ROA) 1974 (Exceptions) Order 1975 (as amended) the successful candidate(s) will be subject to a criminal records check with the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS).

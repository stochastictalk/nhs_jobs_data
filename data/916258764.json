These include outpatient rapid diagnostic and treatment facilities, a minor injuries unit, limb fitting services and 70 elderly, intermediate care and rehabilitation beds.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As well as hospital services, we provide a wide variety of specialist, maternity and community services to children, adults, older people and people with learning disabilities.

We are also looking for team members who are willing and keen to learn new skills and can provide on the job training to personnel showing a real attribute and willingness to learn and develop skills in pharmaceutical aseptic services.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Working in the aseptic units is a very satisfying job. You will work with trained technicians and pharmacists and as part of a large team undertake the production and dispensing of medicines that make a real difference to patient care - the patients we treat are often the sickest and most vulnerable in the hospital. These medicines are not available commercially and so patients really depend on us getting it right all the time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may have experience of working in a GMP production environment and be able to show you can work accurately, efficiently and follow procedures at all times. Due to the critical nature of our work you will have to meet the highest standards of discipline, personal hygiene, attention to detail and clean room behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For Further Details:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Jemma Turnbull - Principal Pharmacy Technician: Chemotherapy Services jemma.turnbull@gstt.nhs.uk&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;020 7188 7940&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Closing date: 18 November 2020 at Midnight&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Proposed interview date: Thursday 3rd December 2020&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For further details:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;NameJemma TurnbullAdditional contact information&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Jemma Turnbull - Principal Pharmacy Technician: Chemotherapy Services&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;jemma.turnbull@gstt.nhs.uk&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/121066.jpg", "name": "Guy's and St. Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=121066"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Guy&#39;s Hospital, London", "postalCode": "SE1 9RT"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "51.5046", "longitude": "-.088964"}}, "title": "Pharmacy Production Support Worker, Higher level \u2013 Aseptic services", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916255071", "validThrough": "2020-11-18T23:59:59+0000"}

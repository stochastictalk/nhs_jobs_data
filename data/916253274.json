By providing the right support at the right time, and making sure that people can find all the help they need, we have grown into one of the largest providers of substance misuse services in England and Wales. Right now, we are now looking for a talented Peer Mentor &amp; Volunteer Team Leader to work within our community-based substance misuse services in the City of London and Hackney.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The service is delivered in partnership with Mind CHWF and London Friend and there is a focus on partnership working throughout the service to support those in the local community who need assistance to achieve their goals. We deliver treatment and support across the neighbourhoods ensuring a holistic and inclusive approach to recovery in this service.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Passionate about people, you\u2019ll enjoy the opportunity and support to enhance your own life and career too, as you gain the experience and training you need to progress in your career within a social enterprise. So if you\u2019re ambitious and ready for a fresh challenge with a sector leader then this could be the opportunity for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Role Responsibility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As Peer Mentor &amp; Volunteer Team leader, you\u2019ll be responsible for recruiting, training and supporting our volunteers and peer mentors. That means you\u2019ll be involved in everything from developing appropriate protocols and implementing supervising structures, to designing and delivering training modules and providing on-the-job support and professional guidance. Beyond this, you\u2019ll also keep a close eye on volunteer case work and help to develop and deliver our Peer Mentoring Programme too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;By working closely with healthcare professionals such as GPs and social services, your dedication will make a better future.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Ideal Candidate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An inspirational leader with plenty of experience when it comes to recruiting and managing volunteers, we\u2019re looking for someone with great communication skills and the ability to engage and build relationships with people from a wide range of backgrounds. Experience of coaching and mentoring others will also be key to this role. Ideally, you\u2019ll have some experience in a substance misuse setting, but that isn\u2019t essential. What is essential is that you\u2019re passionate about supporting the community and know what it takes to work to deadlines and achieve results against specific targets and goals.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About us&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why Turning Point?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a leading health and social care provider with more than 300 locations across England, we take real pride in the services we offer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Across the varied regions, sectors and settings we operate within, our organisation is held together by a shared vision \u2013 and our people are connected by the same values. These include belief in potential, confidence in communication, embracing positive change and always treating each other as individuals.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We run all of our services on a not-for-profit basis; instead, we invest every penny back into our services and people. We never stop believing in change for the better, and we work constantly to improve the lives of the people we support.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our people bring our vision to life. So, if you are enthusiastic, motivated and committed to support others to fulfilling their potential, here at Turning Point, we don&#39;t just offer you a job \u2013 we offer you a career.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Benefits Will I Receive?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Of course, we know it&#39;s not about the money. But that doesn&#39;t mean we don&#39;t reward our people for their invaluable work with a benefits package that includes:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Comprehensive opportunities to learn and develop, with silver accreditation from\u00a0&lt;em&gt;Investors in People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;31 days\u2019 paid holiday a year, increasing with each year of service up to 33 days.

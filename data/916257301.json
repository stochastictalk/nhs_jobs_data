This post is designed to both deliver high quality endoscopic care and allow training in advanced endoscopic techniques. This will help in furthering a career in gastroenterology with an interest in endoscopy and is available to applicants who want to take time out of programme or for post CCT candidates.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is an opportunity to join a dynamic gastroenterology team in a highly supportive environment. The successful candidates would contribute to the provision of endoscopic services for both in and outpatients and contribute to the gastroenterology bleed on call rota (1 in 8). Within their endoscopy service commitments, the post holder would also be expected to provide occasional support to the endoscopy service across the SEL region. This would involve providing occasional adhoc support for endoscopy sessions at KCH (King\u2019s College Hospital and Lewisham and Greenwich Hospital). There are no general medical on call commitments in this post.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We offer a wide range of endoscopic services to inpatients and outpatients. We have a varied portfolio of tertiary endoscopy services, including endoscopic ultrasound, cyst gastrostomy, oesophageal and colonic endotherapy (e.g. HALO RFA, endoscopic mucosal resections, complex colonic polypectomies), tertiary pancreato-biliary procedures, capsule endoscopy an oesophageal physiology. The successful candidates will be given opportunities to train in one or more of these advanced endoscopic techniques depending on their requirements/preference.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For further information and to apply online, please go to our website quoting reference number &lt;strong&gt;MED2216.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Closing date: 22nd November 2020, at midnight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As an organisation we are committed to developing our services in ways that best suit the needs of our patients.

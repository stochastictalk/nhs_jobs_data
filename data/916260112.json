Depending on the level of experience, we will endeavour to tailor the post to allow all necessary competences, to be achieved. For trainees hoping to apply for national training numbers, we will help them to achieve required competences for national selection at ST3 level. More senior trainees will be given the opportunity to develop their skills in their chosen sub-specialties.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Plastic surgery department, regional burns centre for adults and paediatric burns unit are situated on the Pinderfields site with outpatient and day-case services at Pontefract General Hospital and Dewsbury District Hospital.

We also have representation on the breast and skin cancer MDTs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;A number of our consultants are conveners and faculty members for local and national courses. We regularly undertake clinical and viva practice for FRCS (Plast) candidates, ST3 interview practice and run simulation workshops for our trainees, such as suturing, skin grafting, tendon repair and fracture fixation. We encourage our trainees to actively participate, and be involved in the organisation of, multiple courses aimed at sixth formers all the way up to senior trainees. This provides an excellent opportunity for trainees to develop the teaching and training components of their portfolios.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We are proud to have research collaborations with the University of Bradford and Huddersfield University. Our previous research fellows and Trust grade registrars have secured a National Training Number at national selections. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Our departmental ethos is to promote high quality, patient centred care in burns and plastic surgery through education, training and research in an environment that is supportive, inclusive, and forward thinking.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;These posts will be part of our 1:8 or 1:9 STR / Registrar level trainee on call rota (TBC) \u2013 which is compliant with working time regulations and the 2016 junior doctor\u2019s contract, averaging 48 hours per week. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/120735.png", "name": "Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=120735"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Wakefield", "postalCode": "WF1 4DG"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "53.6949", "longitude": "-1.48592"}}, "title": "MYDoc - Hand or Breast or Burns Fellow at Registrar Level", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916260112", "validThrough": "2020-11-17T23:59:59+0000"}

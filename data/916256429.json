The department of Acute Medicine consists of an Acute Medical Unit and an Acute Ambulatory Assessment Unit, both based at the Royal Blackburn Teaching Hospital.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our Acute Medical Unit has significantly expanded to an 82-bedded unit in the last 18 months with improved facilities, additional staff, point-of-care ultrasound facilities, and newly recruited Advanced Nurse practitioners. There is ongoing expansion of ambulatory care services, and there are multiple in-reach services into AMU. We are one of the Future Hospitals sites and are working towards a future hospital model of acute care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are keen to consider applications from candidates who have a medical specialty interest that may benefit the service. We do not just look at what you have achieved so far; we aim to support you through your future career aims and nurture your future development. You may want to be a research or an education lead, or bring fresh ideas on how to develop the service; we will do our utmost to help you achieve your potential. We take training and development seriously and encourage you to do the same and participate in a consultant leadership programme. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our main hospital sites Royal Blackburn Teaching Hospital and Burnley General Teaching Hospital are Teaching Hospitals.

We are looking for HR &amp; Training Support Assistants to support CCAS. These posts will support the service up until 31March 2021.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are proud to say that CCAS has already on-boarded over 2,000 GPs and Clinicians. As the second wave of COVID-19 is emerging we need to increase the CCAS capacity and have therefore re-opened our portal for further GP recruitment. These roles will help us to on-board additional GPs and also provide ongoing support and management of the current workforce.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The postholder will ensure a high level HR and Training support service is provided. This includes support with ID checks, completion of statutory/mandatory training, off-boarding and general queries, and administration tasks.&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/127935.jpg", "name": "South, Central and West Commissioning Support Unit", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=127935"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Various Locations", "postalCode": "SO50 5PB"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "50.9674", "longitude": "-1.35105"}}, "title": "HR and Training Support Assistant", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916255701", "validThrough": "2020-11-17T23:59:59+0000"}

The post is full time (10 PAs) with 3 PAs being spent at KMMS and 7 PAs within EKHUFT.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The successful applicant for this post is eligible for a competitive recruitment and retention scheme.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust manages three acute district general hospitals (at Margate, Canterbury and Ashford) with two supporting hospitals (at Dover and Folkestone). The Trust was awarded University status in August 2008 and Foundation status in April 2009. The Trust is one of the largest in the country, employing over 7000 people and serving a local population of approximately 700,000. The Trust provides a full range of local services across its sites and some specialist services including renal medicine, haemophilia, neurology and vascular surgery.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Kent and Medway Medical School (KMMS) is a new medical school, bringing together the existing centres of excellence in health and medical education provided by the University of Kent and Canterbury Christ Church University and local healthcare organisations, to offer a new model of person-centred medical education. The School will open in September 2020, offering 100 undergraduate medical places on a yearly basis. The five-year undergraduate programme will be taught at the Canterbury campuses of both university partners with medical placements within primary, community and secondary care across Kent and Medway.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are seeking a dynamic individual for this exciting opportunity to establish a clinical immunology service in East Kent in addition to contributing to the academic activities of the new medical school. The appointee will be expected to help and oversee provision across all areas of immunology (allergy, immunodeficiency and laboratory immunology). A busy (more than 250,000 tests per annum) UKAS ISO15189 accredited laboratory immunology service operates from our Ashford laboratory, supported by a team of specialised biomedical scientists and providing laboratory immunology services to the whole of Kent. There are currently no clinical immunology services offered within Kent and Medway (population 1.8 million) and this new post represents an exciting opportunity to develop and expand such provision. East Kent Hospitals Trust is fully committed to the development of this new service.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The appointee will have a leadership position within the medical school, delivering an appropriate taught module (musculoskeletal and immunology) in year 2 of the academic programme. Three PAs will be devoted to teaching delivery, student selection, assessment and pastoral and academic support activities.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The post-holder will have full GMC registration, will be a Fellow of the Royal College of Pathologists or equivalent, and be on the Specialist Register or within six months of receiving the certificate of completion of training (CCT) at the time of the interview. The appointee will be supported in working towards a teaching qualification (if they do not already have one).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is an exciting time to develop your clinical and academic career in Kent, establishing a new clinical service and contributing to medical education in a new medical school. East Kent is an area of outstanding natural beauty with large areas of unspoilt countryside and easy access to the continent. It is a delightful place to live with a fantastic coastline, beautiful villages and the cathedral city of Canterbury. The high speed rail link offers easy access to London. Kent has retained the grammar school system and there are excellent state and private schools.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For further details / informal visits contact:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Professor Chris Holland, Founding Dean, Professor of Medical Education, Consultant in Intensive Care, KMMS dean@kmms.ac.uk&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Dr Anna Romito, Undergraduate Programme Director, Deputy Dean, KMMS anna.romito@kmms.ac.uk&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Dr Edmund Lamb, Clinical Director of Pathology, EKHUFT on 01227 864112 or elamb@nhs.net&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Dr Rebecca Martin, Chief Medical Officer, EKHUFT rebecca.martin27@nhs.net&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=121462"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "William Harvey Hospital &amp; Kent and Medway Medical School, Ashford", "postalCode": "TN24 0LZ"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "51.1415", "longitude": ".91624"}}, "title": "Consultant Immunologist &amp; Senior Lecturer", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916242612", "validThrough": "2020-11-23T23:59:59+0000"}

The Trust is at the forefront of the integrated care agenda through its symphony project. We have also received government funding for a full electronic healthcare record system (including Pharmacy and ePrescribing) being implemented in 2020/21. We provide full medicines management and dedicated discharge services throughout the Trust, and to local hospices. Through our commercial contract work with Somerset community services we also supply mental health (including clozapine).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The pharmacy department enjoys excellent IT support from robots, tablets and mobiles. We have a busy Aseptic Services Unit producing chemotherapy and have a significant involvement in the provision of clinical trials. Our key strengths as a department are that we work hard for each other and create a positive working environment. This is underpinned by the Trusts iCARE principals which have now been adopted in a number of NHS Trusts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The successful applicant will join our friendly team of pharmacy assistants, technicians and pharmacists who work together to manage the accurate and efficient supply of both dispensed and stock medicines to the hospital patients and our community clients. The successful candidate will be trained to work rotationally between the dispensary and distribution areas.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Please note that when working in the distribution department there is an element of heavy lifting involved in the IV fluid store.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Weekends are worked on a rotational basis (currently about 1 in 8 weekends are worked). There is also a bank holiday rota in operation which does not currently require any member of staff to work more than 1 per year.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you\u2019re looking for new challenges in a friendly and supportive hospital pharmacy department, this post may well be just what you are looking for.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits of working for us:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Working for a Trust voted 1st for Health and Well-being across the UK (NHS staff survey)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Full NHS terms and conditions including extensive holidays, Agenda for Change pay with enhancements&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Discounts for local and national retailers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Dedicated well-being services for all employees&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Flexible working where possible&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a full time role for 37.5 hours per week, with one day to be 9:30 to 18:00&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For further details / informal visits contact:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Annie Harris -Pharmacy Procurement and Distribution Lead&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;annie.harris@ydh.nhs.uk - 01935 383179&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/121892.jpg", "name": "Yeovil District Hospital NHS Foundation Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=121892"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Yeovil District Hospital, Yeovil", "postalCode": "BA21 4AT"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "50.9453", "longitude": "-2.63391"}}, "title": "Pharmacy Assistant", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916254305", "validThrough": "2020-11-17T23:59:59+0000"}

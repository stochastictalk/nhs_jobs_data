This role has been made possible through NHS Charitable Funds, upon receipt of which we had the choice of investing in many options, however we wanted to utilise the money to ensure we continue to focus on the health and wellbeing of our people and teams and also their family members. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Outreach Support Workers will engage with our people who have been disproportionally impacted by the covid pandemic. The focus will be on our people who have been at higher risk, or those who have been personally impacted during the previous ten months, whether this is financially, physically or mentally. They will liaise with our Staying Well Service and Management Teams to put in place additional and appropriate welfare support and provide advice and signposting in an integrated and seamless way by taking a person centred approach based on individual circumstances and needs. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Outreach Support Workers will act as a point of contact for employees and managers and draw on expertise within the Trust. This will extend to our people\u2019s family members and members of the community by holding internal and external engagement events that will enable further learning from our peoples experiences over the past eight months, to then recommend specific measures and additional support the Trust can put in place moving forward. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;The successful candidates will be supported by our Staying Well Service and HR Business Partner Team and will be invited to important forums such as our Staff Wellbeing Engagement Event and our Equality Steering Group meetings. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you have any questions about this secondment opportunity then please do not hesitate to contact Lauren.Dunn@swast.nhs.uk or Michelle.Stevens@swast.nhs.uk &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*The localities that will be covered in this role will be discussed at the interview.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;This position is Part Time (18.75 hours)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "OTHER", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/121045.png", "name": "South Western Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=121045"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "North Division*", "postalCode": "BS32 4QJ"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "51.5485", "longitude": "-2.55641"}}, "title": "Outreach Support Worker (INTERNAL ONLY)", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916244044", "validThrough": "2020-11-06T23:59:59+0000"}

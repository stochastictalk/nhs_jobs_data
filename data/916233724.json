This is an exciting and unique opportunity to work in a fast-paced and well-supported environment where delivering excellent patient care is at the heart of our service. We are seeking at least three colleagues to join the team. We encourage applicants from diverse backgrounds and can offer both whole-time or part-time roles.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;London North West University Healthcare NHS Trust is one of the largest integrated care Trusts in the country bringing together hospital and community services across the boroughs of Brent, Harrow and Ealing. Our 9,000 staff serve a diverse population of approximately 850,000. The Trust was established in October 2014 following the merger of The North West London Hospitals NHS Trust and Ealing Hospital NHS Trust and has an annual budget of over \u00a3640 million. LNWUH became a Teaching Trust in 2017 and has strong links with the Imperial College School of Medicine. There are numerous opportunities for undergraduate and postgraduate education.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;One post will be based predominantly at Ealing hospital and up to 2.5 WTE posts will be based mainly at Northwick Park.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Northwick Park Hospital:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Northwick Park is a Major Acute Hospital with a busy medical take and an established reputation for patients presenting with a very wide range of medical conditions with a high degree of acuity. Recognition of the vital role that is played by Acute Medicine has seen the Trust make a substantial investment in the service. This will enable the department to develop three Acute Medical Unit wards (on a phased approach) with patients remaining under the care of the acute team for their duration on the unit. In addition the team runs the award-winning Ambulatory Emergency Care Unit and the well-established Medical High Dependency Unit. Participation in HDU will be optional dependent on previous experience and competencies.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The post holders will join six acute medicine consultants, fourteen acute/specialty consultants and thirty-three specialty medical consultants who together are responsible for providing the acute and general internal medicine service at Northwick Park Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ealing Hospital:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Acute Medicine service is thriving at Ealing hospital. After an uncertain period during which the Emergency Department faced closure with unclear implications for acute services on the site we can now plan with confidence for the future. The department has a well-deserved reputation for excellence in teaching and training.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Acute Medical Unit is a 33-bedded ward through which all acute medical admissions are streamed. The department is in the process of expanding the Ambulatory Service. A new unit has recently been opened, co-located with the Acute Frailty Service. The team has pioneered ambulatory care for patients with Heart Failure, winning multiple awards. The challenge now is to stream a larger proportion of medical referrals through the Ambulatory Service.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Interview date - TBC&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For further details / informal visits contact:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Rachel Tennant, Clinical Lead, Acute Medicine rachel.tennant@nhs.net Tel \u2013 07748 635 874&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Sarah Ingham, General Manager, Acute Medicine sarah.ingham1@nhs.net Tel \u2013 07876 590 703&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/120623.png", "name": "London North West University Healthcare NHS Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=120623"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Northwick Park Hospital &amp; Ealing Hospital, London", "postalCode": "HA1 3UJ"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "51.5751", "longitude": "-.322459"}}, "title": "Consultant in Acute Medicine", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916233724", "validThrough": "2020-11-10T23:59:59+0000"}

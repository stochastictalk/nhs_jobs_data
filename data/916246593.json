We\u2019re embarking on an unprecedented clinical transformation programme that will revolutionise the way we work. We\u2019ve partnered with a world-class medical software company to introduce Hive, a brand-new Electronic Patient Record (EPR) solution that will bring all our patient information into one easily accessible place and make our services more effective than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Hive is the largest initiative of its kind and is backed by a significant multi-million-pound investment. It\u2019s also an exciting opportunity to bring your expertise, join us at the beginning of our journey and develop through a challenging, complex project. With your help, we\u2019ll build on our leading initiatives and transform our services for the benefit of patients and staff alike.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a Beaker EPR Application Analyst, you\u2019ll design and configure the Beaker Laboratory EPR module and adapt it to our working practices and standards. Your work will be a vital link between the new technology and our services and will ensure our transition to Hive is a success.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You\u2019ll work closely with our staff to analyse our current processes, then agree on clinical and operational standards and future workflows to be incorporated into Epic, the software that runs Hive.

But there are also opportunities to work with other EPR module teams across testing, security, user support and medical device integration.

A project management or relevant postgraduate qualification is preferred, but not essential.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Great benefits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Join us at the forefront of change and you\u2019ll enjoy plenty of opportunities, together with all the benefits you can expect as an NHS employee.

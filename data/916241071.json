Knowledge and experience of these ways of working would therefore be an advantage.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The role will also enable the post holder to contribute to audit and evaluation of this pilot service in order to support future service commissioning and the development of new models of best practice.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Rough Sleeper&#39;s Initiative&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With homeless figures continuing to rise and the NHS Long Term Plan (2019) recognising the need for better physical and mental health interventions to address homelessness; Public Health has awarded funds to pilot new community-based models of access to clinical support for those rough sleeping or at risk of returning to rough sleeping.

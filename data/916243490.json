Have you a track record delivering improvement ideas within your clinical area? The role of the QI Facilitator may be what you are looking for.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Whilst there will be a project management element to the position, we are particularly looking for an individual with an interest and experience in quality improvement. We believe that sustainable change is best driven by the staff who deliver care, and you will help build their talent to achieve this particularly through supporting the roll out of improvement huddles, training and coaching. As a Trust we have adopted the Quality, Service Improvement and Redesign (QSIR) methodology; it is therefore desirable that you are trained in this but more important is that you have skills and experience of using QI methodologies. A positive, flexible style and approach is necessary along with strong organisation, communication and interpersonal skills in this rewarding role as this is a trust wide position whereby you will be working with a range of stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For further details / informal visits contact:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Debbie Begent, QI Lead&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Email address : debbie.begent@nhs.net&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Telephone number : 07818411476&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=120887"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Stoke Mandeville, Stoke Mandeville", "postalCode": "HP7 0JD"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "51.663", "longitude": "-.621366"}}, "title": "Quality Improvement Facilitator", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916243490", "validThrough": "2020-11-09T23:59:59+0000"}

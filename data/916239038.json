Each year, seasonal flu affects thousands of people in the UK.

The wellbeing of our staff and patients is of the utmost importance to us, and it is the expectation of the Trust that all patient-facing staff have an annual flu vaccination, provided free of charge by the Trust. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/122793.png", "name": "West London NHS Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=122793"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Askew Ward (LS PICU), Southall", "postalCode": "UB1 3EU"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "51.5067", "longitude": "-.351054"}}, "title": "Healthcare Facilitator", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916239038", "validThrough": "2020-11-13T23:59:59+0000"}

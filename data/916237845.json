We are seeking a dynamic and motivated individual to join the clinical leadership team.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ward 3 is a 22 bedded General Medical ward specialising in Respiratory Medicine and there is also a procedure room working alongside the ward which assists in providing early diagnosis, care and treatment intervention for a range of respiratory conditions, thus enhancing patient experience and care.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a supportive and encouraging environment with an opportunity to learn many new skills within an acute setting, whilst working alongside the multidisciplinary team (MDT) and contributing to high quality care and intervention.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ward is unique within the health board and effectively manages the higher level of patient dependencies such as those requiring Non Invasive Ventilation (NIV) and complex chest drain management, amongst other conditions. The staffing levels are reflective of this higher acuity requirement.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The environment is pleasant and has three respiratory consultants who work closely with the team on a daily basis and the Respiratory specialist nurses also work very closely with the MDT to enable prompt discharges and facilitate the community needs of the respiratory patient being discharged.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rota involves a variety of shift patterns to suit service requirements and to support the needs of the staff on the ward. We have a mixture of both long and short shifts and the rota covers days, nights, weekends and bank holidays.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the Band 6 Junior Sister/Charge Nurse you will be expected to assist the Ward Sister with managing and leading the ward, ensuring the quality and safety standards are maintained.

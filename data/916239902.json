We have an exciting opportunity for a new Retrieval Assistant to join our Liverpool team based in our state-of-the-art Tissue Bank in Speke.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a Retrieval Assistant you will receive extensive hands on training to enable you to carry out the physical retrieval of tissues such as eyes, hearts, skin and bone from deceased donors \u2013 this process often takes place in a mortuary setting. You will be trained in the specialist tissue banking techniques that ensure NHSBT provide gold standard grafts to recipients all over the country. You will start work with NHSBT as a Retrieval Assistant (Band 3 - \u00a319,737 to \u00a321,142) progressing to Senior Retrieval Assistant (Band 4 \u2013 \u00a321,892 to \u00a324,157) following successful completion of your training \u2013 we anticipate this will take 6-12 months. As a Senior Retrieval Assistant, you will be responsible for the retrieval of eyes without supervision.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Due to the urgent nature of tissue donation you will be required to work evenings and weekends within a 7-day, 365 scheduled rota.

I am a man who experiences autism, epilepsy and sometimes I may display behaviour which can be described as challenging. I enjoy going out and about every day, but I can get anxious when I don&#39;t know what is happening, something annoys me or if I don&#39;t understand what is going on. I am lots of fun to be with and want people to work with me who care about me and are dedicated to supporting me to do every day things like eating healthily, keeping fit and learning new skills. I have my own ways of doing things, which the rest of my team will help you to learn, and if you&#39;re the right person, we&#39;ll get on great!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I love to go to my favourite parks and for long walks in the countryside, and going out for cake! Be mature minded and be able to forward plan, helping me develop my skills.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I love a foot massage as it relaxes me and keeps me calm.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I cannot speak but I can tell you what I want to do by using my picture communication system. You need to learn my language, and we can then have some fun.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I must have a predictable, structured and consistent routine.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shift Patterns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a 24 hour service.

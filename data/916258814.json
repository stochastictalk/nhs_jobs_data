Working with our partners, Public Health Wales has a key system leadership role in our pandemic response. This includes in providing specialist advice to Welsh Government, working with our partners and the public, to take actions to suppress and control the virus, and promoting a wider public health approach to population health and well-being to address inequalities in health. Our new Operational Plan describes how we are approaching this; including re-mobilising our workforce and ensuring key services are reactivated.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Public Health Services Directorate is responsible for a portfolio of Health Protection, Microbiology and Screening services. In responding to and learning lessons from the challenges of COVID-19, we continue to transform our services to deliver a world-class service for the prevention, management and control of health protection threats as well as our many screening services.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With the imminent retirement of the Executive Director of Public Health Services, we are now looking to second an Interim Deputy Director of Public Health Services to support the Acting Executive Director over the next period.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a national leadership role in Wales with responsibility for supporting the Acting Executive Director and, on their behalf, leading the development and delivery of an agreed portfolio of responsibilities.

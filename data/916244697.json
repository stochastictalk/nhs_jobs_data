The ideal candidate will demonstrate a passion for excellent quality, person-centred care, be driven to work dynamically, creatively and passionately with other key partner organisations in order to achieve the best possible outcomes for our patients. Collaborative working, making decisions based upon sound clinical reasoning and having the ability to adapt and flex your way of thinking and approach is essential.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With reference to this role, we truly value applicants both with an AHP or nursing background. Within our teams and broader within LCHS we champion the unique skills that each profession has to offer: it is difficult to summarise the opportunities afforded within this role in so few words and so please do not hesitate to contact Liana (Clinical Service Lead) to further discuss how your experience and skills could complement and enhance our offer to the people of Lincolnshire.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you relish working under pressure, have an eye for service improvement and always put the person at the heart of everything you do then we look forward to hearing from you.

Looking to use your skills and experience in a new setting?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An exciting opportunity has arisen for an experienced Clinical or Forensic Psychologist to join the established and supportive team of Clinical and Forensic Psychologists already inputting into Secure Services at Brooklands Hospital. The post holder will provide a lead role within the new autism service at Brooklands and the Forensic Assessment, Consultation, and Training Team for people with Learning Disabilities (FACTT-LD). There is strong multi-disciplinary working within both of these services and the post would be split between the two roles.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FACTT-LD&lt;/strong&gt; is commissioned as part of the Transforming Care agenda. It is a consultation model that supports Community Learning Disability Teams (CLDTs) and Intensive Service Teams (IST\u2019s) to develop the skills and confidence in working with and managing cases with forensic risk issues (behaviours that could lead to involvement in the Criminal Justice System). The successful applicant may also have a small case load where they work directly with individuals who may pose a forensic risk in the community. They will also provide supervision to other psychologists and disciplines within the FACTT-LD service and develop working relationships with other Criminal Justice agencies, such as the Police and Probation Service.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specialist Male Autism Low Secure Service&lt;/strong&gt; - This is an exciting new development of a low secure provision for men with autism on the Brooklands site.

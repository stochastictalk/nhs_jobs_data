Quite simply, we couldn\u2019t run our hospitals without you and the fantastic work you will do keeping our wards, departments and areas clean and tidy as part of an extra team we are taking on to work with us until approximately March 2021. Join us to help us fight covid-19 head on, cleaning to new NHS standards, doing everything in our power to keep our staff well and our patients safe.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We know you will love the work you do, seeing how you make such a big impact in keeping everything ticking over smoothly, your dedication will shine through. We want you to be proud to wear your Domestic Assistant uniform, feeling what a strong and vital part of our hospital team you really are \u2013 knowing you are working side by side on the front-lines making a HUGE difference every single day.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You will of course be a key team member of our Hospital team, showing care and compassion for our patients and their visitors, your effective communication skills will be particularly useful here as you pass the time of day, or help someone with directions whilst undertaking your vital cleaning duties.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, your duties will include general cleaning of the wards, public and staff areas, on a rota with your colleagues as part of our Domestic Team. As you would expect, we do have set cleaning standards and NHS guidelines to work towards and these are even more detailed now as we fight this pandemic. So whilst there is no experience required, we will fully train you on all of this to ensure you will soon be at the top of your game.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The work can be physically demanding and we don\u2019t shy away from this. A lot of the things we have to intensively clean are below waist height as they are often areas which need the most attention. Pesky bits of dirt and grime would thrive there if our fab team members didn\u2019t do such a great job cleaning them and keeping them spick and span.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Of course we want you to be friendly, reliable and conscientious as this role isn&#39;t just about vacuuming, mopping and cleaning, it\u2019s about being part of a whole team of staff working together to ensure the best environment for our patients to receive their treatments.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We offer you the flexibility to work around your personal commitments \u2013 going home at the end of your shift knowing you played your part in making our hospitals a great place to be cared for. We have a variety of shift patterns available, so welcome you to state on your application form what kind of hours you are looking for.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There are allsorts of training opportunities to ensure you have all the right knowledge to do the role and we actively encourage you to develop and support you to progress within the organisation if that\u2019s what you are looking for.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you are currently unemployed and interested in knowing more, but feel you would need help to understand the roles, put together an application and prepare for interview, then ask your Jobcentre Plus Work Coach about the Work and Health and JETS programmes which can provide this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to have a chat to find out more about us and our fab team, don\u2019t hesitate to contact Jason.jackson-bates@lthtr.nhs.uk&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=121125"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Preston, Preston", "postalCode": "PR2 9HT"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "53.7909", "longitude": "-2.70449"}}, "title": "Domestic Assistant", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916207874", "validThrough": "2020-11-19T23:59:59+0000"}

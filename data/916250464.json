The ward also takes acute orthopaedic trauma from the larger sites of SGH and DPOW. The aim on transfer is to rehabilitate the patient and to safely discharge them back to the community.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We also house our own pre assessment service along with orthopaedic clinics. The pre Assessment service aims to streamline the process of admission to the ward area and also identifies any patient issues that need to be addressed prior to hospital admission. This is a very busy area and organisational skills are essential.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Ward 6 has also been tasked with providing the additional service of a HOBS bay. This will accommodate patients that we class as a higher anaesthetic grade patient that historically would be admitted at the larger acute sites of Scunthorpe and Grimsby.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The HOB will operate on a staffing level of 1+1 and the registered nurse will be expected to provide direct patient care. They will take the lead of the patient care directly associated to patients in the HOB. This will include conducting ward rounds and being part of the decision making process to step the patient back down to the general ward area.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The candidate will be supported by colleagues and ward sisters within this role and will be part of a small friendly team.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Ward 7 Provides day surgery services to patients. The process for this area is to care for patients from admission to discharge within a 12 hour scope of nursing care. This involves admission, pre and post-operative care following procedure and safe discharge. Any patients admitted to ward 7 that are undergoing a major procedure will transfer to our other area ward6 where they will recover from their surgery. The day surgery unit operates a 5 day per week service opening Monday \u2013 Friday 8am-8pm.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is an exciting opportunity to gain skills in working in acute care of the surgical patient. All applicants should demonstrate a keen interest in care of the surgical patient and previous experience would be extremely desirable although not essential.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The applicant may be expected to rotate into all surgical areas including the inpatient area of ward 6 , day surgery (Ward 7) and also pre assessment clinics. Cross cover for the area is essential and the post will be rotational across a 7 day service working nights days and weekends.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are looking for highly enthusiastic motivated candidates that are passionate about surgery and are keen to support this service. It is a variable role that includes all different aspects of surgical nursing care.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For further details / informal visits contact:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Katie White, Ward Manager&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;katie.white35@nhs.net&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;03033 304114&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Sophie Hutchinson, Deputy Ward Manager&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;03033 304114&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/121065.png", "name": "Northern Lincolnshire and Goole NHS Foundation Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=121065"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Goole", "postalCode": "DN14 6RX"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "53.7154", "longitude": "-.874498"}}, "title": "Staff Nurse - Ward 7 - Goole", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916250464", "validThrough": "2020-11-15T23:59:59+0000"}

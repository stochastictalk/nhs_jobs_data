We are consistently within the national top ten performing Emergency Departments. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;With a new senior nursing leadership team comprising of a senior matron and 2 new matrons now in post we are looking to take our ED forward with a new workforce strategy. Both departments are supported by paediatric ambulatory units and Tunbridge Wells has a paediatric consultant present at peak times. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We are a progressive and dynamic team looking to expand our staff numbers. You will have significant experience in an acute paediatric or A&amp;E setting. Ideally you will have completed an emergency care qualification, EPALS and will be able to provide evidence of professional development, shift management, and staff development. We can provide a proactive learning environment as well as many supportive in service learning opportunities. The emergency care qualification/minor injuries course could be available for the right candidate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You will be expected to attend the Trust\u2019s Induction Programme for RNs, RMs and ODPs (which starts on the first day of employment). The programme is full-time (please contact the programme lead if this is problematic: nicola.henthorn@nhs.net), lasts for two weeks and will involve travelling to both Trust sites. The programme includes supernumerary shifts in the clinical area and classroom-based study days which run from 9am to 5pm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Please note that appointment to this post will be subject to a satisfactory Disclosure &amp; Barring Service Check at enhanced level.

We take equality and diversity seriously and seek to empower all diverse groups within our trust. We seek to develop a culture where diversity in all its forms is celebrated.

We work across our trust to enable those who consider themselves to have a disability both visible and invisible to have access to all they need to thrive in their work environment. We work with Stonewall to embed an inclusive and accepting culture for all lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender staff. We have 78 nationalities working in our trust and we are proud of this. We are active in embracing the ethnic and cultural diversity in our trust.

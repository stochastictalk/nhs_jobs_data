The NHS Long Term Plan focuses on delivering integrated care to patients at the local level and we can best support the NHS to deliver this as a single integrated organisation. Our new operating model represents a strong shift to regional delivery supported by expert corporate teams. Local health systems are supported by our integrated regional teams who play a major leadership role in the geographies they manage.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are jointly committed to creating and maintaining a fair and supportive working environment and culture, where contributions are fully recognised and valued by all and staff feel empowered to carry out their duties to the best of their abilities. As employers we are committed to promoting and protecting the physical and mental health and well-being of all our staff. This underpins our values as set out in the NHS Constitution, supports us to be an Employer of Choice and ultimately enables our employees to support the effective care of our patients.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The seven integrated regions of our joint enterprise will work with local systems to support and improve how care is provided to patients and communities. These regions will be supported by the corporate centre providing expertise and developing policy. The focus will be on guiding and managing the delivery of services through local integrated health systems, sustainability and transformation partnerships, and devolution areas.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Yorkshire and the Humber dental commissioning team is responsible for the commissioning and contracting of all NHS dental services across the region, including primary care, secondary care, community dental services, orthodontics, intermediate minor oral surgery and urgent care.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As one of three Dental Contract Managers the post holder will work as part of a dynamic team in delivering an effective service across dental commissioning services, with a focus on the West Yorkshire locality.

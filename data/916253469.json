Many of these patients will have an enteral feeding tube for part of their cancer journey. You will therefore work closely with and be an integral member of the Home Enteral Nutrition Team. You will see patients who are attending their consultant clinics and work closely with the consultants, specialist nurses and the speech and language therapist, providing seamless care to the patient group.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You will also work closely with care providers in the community, providing education and advice on the nutritional care of patients, contributing to the development of safe practices and policies. You would be well supported in a friendly team whose aim is to provide an excellent, compassionate and cost effective service. We are constantly looking at ways to develop our service. You will have the opportunity to conduct audits and be involved in evaluating patient feedback.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Lincolnshire is an interesting county, the second largest in the UK. It is steeped in history with the very beautiful Lincoln cathedral and nearby castle. If you enjoy the countryside, the seaside or football, there will be lots to keep you occupied. If it is a show, or a concert that makes you happy, we have our own Theatre Royal and Nottingham is close by. Even London is only a short train journey away.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An interest in providing nutrition support to patients with cancer and/or home enteral nutrition, some relevant post registration experience and a desire to undertake relevant post-registration training are essential. We will value your ability to use your initiative. You will have a flexible approach, excellent communication and time management skills and the ability to work independently, liaising effectively with a wide range of staff, patients and the public.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The department provides clinical placements for A, B and C dietetic students. Regular CPD is provided and there are opportunities for further training and development.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For further details / informal visits contact:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Name: Katy McMillan or Rachel Thompson&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Job title: Nutrition Support (Head and Neck Oncology) Specialist Dietitian&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Email address: katy.mcmillan@ulh.nhs.uk&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Telephone number: 01522 597765 or 01522 573418&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/121077.jpg", "name": "United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=121077"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Lincoln County Hospital, Greetwell Road, Lincoln, LN2 5QY, Lincoln", "postalCode": "LN2 5QY"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "53.2336", "longitude": "-.51965"}}, "title": "Nutrition Support (Oncology) Specialist Dietitian - Band 6", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916253469", "validThrough": "2020-11-16T23:59:59+0000"}

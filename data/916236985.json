Brain tissue at risk of damage can be saved with active management in the initial hours after a stroke starts. Rapid admission to hospital and access to specialised stroke care, including brain scanning and assessment for thrombolysis, is vital for ensuring the best possible outcome for stroke patients. The Department of Health has encouraged the development of specialised stroke services and published the National Stroke Strategy for improving stroke care nationally. In Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust, we have used this to guide the development of our service and ensure these improvements are actually delivered in practice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust is one of the largest acute Hospital Trusts in the country. We provide acute and specialist services to people across Portsmouth, South East Hampshire and West Sussex. We continue to build our reputation for innovation and excellence, consistently delivering outstanding performance, whilst developing the skills and abilities of our staff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Stroke Service at Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust has developed and continues to evolve to meet the needs of the patients who require specialist Stroke care.

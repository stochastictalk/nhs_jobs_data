At the present time we don\u2019t know who the new provider will be but the CCG is working to determine this by the end of 2020. This change does not affect our ability to recruit and should you be employed at the end of June 2021 you will transfer to the new provider on the same terms and conditions.\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Working for ACE puts you right at the heart of all North Essex has to offer.

The jewel in the crown of its historic past is its Norman castle, built on Roman foundations. A wealth of new homes is complemented by an equally broad selection of character homes in the plethora of picture-postcards villages that surround the town. The likes of Sible Hedingham, Finchingfield and Dedham (the latter being the heart of Constable Country made famous by the artist John Constable) are much sought-after locations.

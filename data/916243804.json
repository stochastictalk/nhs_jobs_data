In specialised mental health this aspiration is being implemented by giving local systems greater accountability by enabling Provider Collaboratives (piloted as New Care Models) to take responsibility for specialised mental health, learning disability and autism services for their population.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Provider Collaboratives will also have more flexibility and incentives to provide the best care for their population, having more clinical autonomy and responsibility and the opportunity to develop high quality new services.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Sussex Partnership is the lead Provider for the CAMHS Provider Collaborative in Hampshire and Dorset. We have developed a clinical model to deliver intensive home treatment as an alternative to hospital admission as well as a supported discharge service to young people leaving hospital.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Working alongside our Provider Collaborative Partners, the Project Manager will support senior clinical and operational leads within and across the wider organisation to mobilise all elements of the new service model.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is an exciting opportunity to work as part of a dynamic team providing professional project management support to operational and clinical leads.

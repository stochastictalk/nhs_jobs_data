A feature of this role is the close working with the wider multi-disciplinary team which includes diabetes specialist nurses, podiatry teams, dieticians, psychologists as well as the team of specialist diabetes and endocrinology doctors. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As part of the leadership team for Pharmacy Medicine services, you will work alongside and be supported by other lead pharmacists in the team, which may include spending time on sites other than your base site.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ideally, you will hold or be willing to work towards a NMP qualification.

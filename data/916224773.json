There will be a particular focus on nurses from Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) groups. To achieve the aim we will undertake two work-packages to address the following research questions:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WP1&lt;/strong&gt;: How was the process of redeploying nursing staff managed prior to and during the Covid-19 crisis?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Method: Interviews with 30 senior staff (across 3 NHS Trusts) responsible for decision making about how, where and when staff were redeployed and what support was provided to these staff and how their return to previous teams was managed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WP2:&lt;/strong&gt; What were the emotional and performative challenges for redeployed nurses and how didthey adapt to and cope with their changing of roles during the Covid-19 crisis?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Method: Questionnaires and follow up interviews with a sample of frontline staff at each Trust. We plan to recruit 60 staff in total (20 from each site) and follow them up at 3 points in time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/em&gt;The successful candidate will join our wider research network: the Yorkshire Quality and Safety Research Group (YQSR group).

The post is based at the Worcestershire Royal Hospital and is an exciting time to join the team as we are working with our CCG\u2019s and Partner organisations to develop a fully integrated countywide pathway. We are looking for a consultant to be actively involved in the design of our new multi-agency service which is moving towards 7 day availability with same day brain and carotid imaging and TIA clinics. We have an approved business case that supports the intention to deliver 7 day services.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Acute Stroke services were centralized on the Worcestershire Royal Hospital site from June 2013 offering a 6-8 bed Hyper Acute Stroke Unit (HASU) and a 20 bedded acute stroke unit. This resulted in Hyperacute Stroke, Acute Stroke, and ambulatory High-Risk TIA care being provided from a single location at Worcester. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To this end we are seeking to recruit well trained and motivated applicants who are able to contribute energy, quality and ideas to this important clinical service as well as aiming to improve our current SSNAP rating and the postholder may participate in the Network rota. Neurointerventional treatments (Thrombectomy) are offered through University Hospitals Birmingham&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u00a0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;For further information or a department visit, please contact Dr Nuno Ribeiro, Stroke Clinical Lead, via switchboard on 01905 763333&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=120654"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Worcester", "postalCode": "WR5 1DD"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "52.1912", "longitude": "-2.18114"}}, "title": "Consultant in Stroke Medicine", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916162067", "validThrough": "2020-12-03T23:59:59+0000"}

Would you like to have time to deliver the care you feel your patients deserve? Would you like to be given the opportunity to develop the skills required to care for the increasing demands of patients who are cared for in the modern NHS. Would you like to feel supported by your team and senior managers?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you have answered yes to the above I am proud to say I am a matron of such a place. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wyre Forest Ward based in the Robertson Centre on the site of Kidderminster Hospital and is part of Worcestershire Health and Care NHS Trust (HACW). The ward holds some of the traditional values of a community hospital with high standards of holistic care, time to talk to your patient, build relationships and be part of their recovery from admission to discharge. Care of the frail elderly with sub-acute care, rehabilitation needs admitted from the community or other acute hospitals from around the county.\u00a0 We also care for patient and their families who require compassionate end of life care. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Our training and development team will train you to have the skills required to care for such complex patients. I support all of my nurses to achieve the Trusts core competencies for RGN\u2019s and provide training to cannulate, perform venepuncture, be IV competent and are able to pass an NG tube.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you are newly qualified the trust offers a preceptorship programme where you would be supported by a ward mentor and the preceptorship programme lead. All staff are now practice assessors so that we can fully support students whilst on placement working closely with Worcester University.\u00a0 If you would like to progress with your own education there are numerous opportunities to do this, in fact I positively promote this as I am passionate about staff development. We have high impact ambassadors/link nurses for a variety of roles from tissue viability to important choices (end of life care). If you have a particular area of interest you are actively encouraged to become a link nurse/ambassador and are provided with the training to perform the role.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I expect my nurses to hold the values of the trust be courageous, ambitious, responsive, empowering and supportive. If you hold these values and my letter appeals to you please spend some time to apply and come and work with me and the team on the ward (trust team of the year 2017). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;All staff whatever their role, level or responsibility will be encouraged and supported to do their job well and to improve their job.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Making Every Day Better for patients, staff, service users and carers is the responsibility of all of us and we want to embed a culture within the organisation that encourages and supports the drive to improve what we do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;\u00a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yours sincerely&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Phil &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Phil Shakeshaft Matron, Princess of Wales Community Hospital Tel: 07918695282&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/120795.jpg", "name": "Herefordshire and Worcestershire Health and Care NHS Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=120795"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Kidderminster", "postalCode": "DY11 6RJ"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "52.3852", "longitude": "-2.26133"}}, "title": "Staff Nurse", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916259418", "validThrough": "2020-11-23T23:59:59+0000"}

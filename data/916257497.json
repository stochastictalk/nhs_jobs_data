We are one of the Top Ten trusts in England for improvements in our emergency care access standards. We have also recently invested \u00a36.2m in improvements across our emergency floor and are looking innovatively about our workforce models across the emergency floor.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In March 2018 the Government and Health Education England announced that a joint bid by Canterbury Christ Church University and the University of Kent to establish a medical school was successful.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The medical school opens its doors in September 2020, offering 100 undergraduate medical places on a yearly basis. The five year programme will be taught at the Canterbury campuses of both universities with medical placements within Primary, Community and Secondary Care across Kent and Medway.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Kent &amp; Medway Medical School (KMMS) will be Kent and Medway\u2019s first ever medical school, bringing together the existing centres of excellence in health and medical education provided by the two universities, and local healthcare organisations such as East Kent Hospitals University Foundation Trust. It will offer a new model of patient-focused medical education.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The KMMS will also play a key part of the solution to the challenges of recruiting and retaining medical professionals for this region. You will have the chance to be there at the start of what is expected to be an exciting and productive relationship and help to shape the Drs of the future.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We would welcome suitably qualified applicants with the drive and energy to join us on our improvement journey as part of our team of Emergency Medicine Consultants. Joining a cross-site workforce of EM consultants, we are ambitious in our desire to expand our emergency medicine consultant workforce. &lt;strong&gt;We are able to offer flexible and enjoyable job-plans for the right applicants and have a competitive recruitment, retention and relocation package available.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We operate two Emergency Departments in Ashford and Margate. Both departments have excellent transport links through the High Speed Line to London and Eurostar into continental Europe. The William Harvey Hospital in Ashford provides full district general facilities in addition to Primary PCI and HASU for the surrounding areas. We are also a Trauma Unit which regularly receives Major Trauma and Helicopter emergencies from KSS air ambulance and Coastguard. The Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother Hospital in Margate also provides district general and HASU facilities, and also provides a helipad for the KSS air ambulance. Both sites have co-located Urgent Care Centres and the Care Group also provides Urgent Care facilities at Kent &amp; Canterbury Hospital and Buckland Hospital Dover.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consultants in Emergency Medicine with Special Interest areas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As part of our workforce transformation, we are looking to appoint Consultants in Emergency Medicine who also have interest in other specialist areas to further develop themselves and the capabilities within the department. Our special interest areas on offer include:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Acute Medicine&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Frailty&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Pre-Hospital Emergency Medicine&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Critical Care&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Paediatric Emergency Medicine&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Medical Education / Simulation&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Research&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We offer our consultants the option of a 10 or 12 PA job plan (7.5DCC/2.5SPA or 9DCC/3SPA) which includes a flexible shift rota between 08:00 \u2013 22:00 weekdays and 8 hours at weekends. Specific individual requirements will also be accommodated where possible, including the ability to have fixed weekdays off or part time positions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There will be a new medical school opening in east Kent from 2020, offering 100 training places per annum. We have been working closely with university partners and other Kent Trusts to see this to fruition and would strongly welcome applicants who may be interested in joint academic and clinical appointments. In addition to the development of others, we are keen to support the professional and academic study of our consultant body. This includes support to study post-graduate qualifications such as MBA or MSc or undertaking academic research.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our emergency medicine consultants are supported by an EM workforce consisting of 25 Middle Grade/ Speciality Doctors, in addition to higher trainees (2) and ACCS posts (4). We support the development of our junior grade workforce by offering special interest posts, a CESR completion route and have a cohort of trainee Advanced Clinical Practitioners supported by our Acute Care Nurse Consultants.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For further details / informal visits contact:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Dr Syed Gilani (Care Group Director for Urgent &amp; Emergency Care) Email: syed.gilani1@nhs.net, or via his PA, Gerry Hook 01233 616171&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Dr Wayne Kissoon (Clinical Lead for ED at QEQM) Email: wayne.kissoon@nhs.net or 01843 225544 extension 6657&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=121462"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "William Harvey Hospital / Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother Hospital, Trustwide", "postalCode": "TN24 0LZ"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "51.1415", "longitude": ".91624"}}, "title": "Consultant in Emergency Medicine with special interests", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916257497", "validThrough": "2020-12-03T23:59:59+0000"}

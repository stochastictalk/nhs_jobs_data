There will be an opportunity to gain knowledge across other emergency surgery specialties, including Plastics and Trauma and Orthopaedics.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Participation in service co-ordination and quality improvement will be integral to this role, particularly as we aim to transfer a bulk of surgical activity to SSDEC pathways this winter to free-up bed capacity.

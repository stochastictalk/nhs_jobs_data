All elective and emergency arterial surgery is performed at CGH. There is a one in six on call vascular rota in which the new appointee would be expected to participate. The post holder\u2019s duties will be split between the main arterial hub at Colchester and our partnership hospital in Ipswich. ESNEFT is under a single Chief Executive, Nick Hulme and currently amalgamating a significant proportion of their services.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There will be approximately 70% of commitments at CGH including ward rounds, clinics, arterial surgery, day surgery, MDT and on call duties. The other 30% of commitments would be at Ipswich Hospital for diabetic multidisciplinary foot clinics, vascular clinics, ward rounds and day case surgery. The Vascular Unit has established a network approach to care in both hospitals in order to provide an equal standard of care for patients at both sites. All of the vascular consultants carry out work at both Ipswich and Colchester Hospitals and as a unit we are gradually moving towards a more equal representation by the Consultants at both sites (correlated to home location).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There is a Hybrid vascular operating theatre and a new (2015) dedicated 20 bed vascular ward designed for patient comfort, infection control and rehabilitation with a patient gym and treatment room in which minor surgery and varicose veins treatments are performed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;ESNEFT has a strong tradition of minimally invasive surgery and has encouraged minimally invasive techniques for vascular surgery. Experience in endovascular work or a desire to acquire these skills would be an important prerequisite. Both Colchester and Ipswich run weekly MDT diabetic foot clinics and ward rounds attended by vascular and orthopaedic foot surgeons. An interest in diabetic foot management and distal bypass surgery would be beneficial for this post.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In addition there is a 20 bed renal dialysis unit at ESNEFT; which is supported by the vascular team providing expertise for vascular renal access procedures at both sites. Therefore experience in renal access surgery, would be desirable.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Candidates must have received training in all aspects of modern vascular surgery including endovascular training. Applicants for Consultant posts must either be GMC registered.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Any candidates wishing to discuss the post should contact Mr Adam Howard (01206 742454), Mr Abu Own or Mr Choksy (01206 742816)&lt;/p&gt;", "employmentType": "FULL_TIME", "hiringOrganization": {"@type": "Organization", "logo": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/db_image/logo/120729.jpg", "name": "East Suffolk and North Essex NHS Foundation Trust", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/agency_info/?agency_id=120729"}, "industry": "Healthcare", "jobLocation": {"@type": "Place", "address": {"@type": "PostalAddress", "addressCountry": "GB", "addressLocality": "Colchester &amp; Ipswich", "postalCode": "CO4 5JL"}, "geo": {"@type": "GeoCoordinates", "latitude": "51.9102", "longitude": ".899214"}}, "title": "Locum Consultant in Vascular Surgery", "url": "https://www.jobs.nhs.uk/xi/vacancy/916237059", "validThrough": "2020-11-21T23:59:59+0000"}

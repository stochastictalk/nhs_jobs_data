The post holder will provide telephone support to cancer patients with guidance from Cancer Clinical Nurse Specialists (CNS) in order to help patients with cancer, navigate their way through their care. This role will require cross-site working with both established Navigator teams at both Frimley Park and Wexham Park Hospitals. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The role requires support with planning and administration for health and well-being events and other supported self-management events for cancer patients. You will also be required to carry out administrative duties to support the CNS teams as part of the implementation of Personalised Care, supporting Holistic Needs Assessment and Treatment Summary information management. The aims are to reduce non clinical phone calls to CNSs to enable them to provide more face to face and clinical support of cancer patients. The post holder would also be providing advice, information and referrals for cancer patients for benefit advice, psychological support and other non-clinical services. The post holder would be ensuring patients get the right support at the right time, to meet their needs, and requires a level of judgment in responding to the needs of individuals. This role demands a good level of communication and judgement to identify the complexity of patients&#39; needs, in order to provide appropriate advice and escalate to relevant cancer CNS as needed. You would be required to be IT competent to support and contribute to audit processes, governance and service development. There would be training given on relevant hospital IT systems and training on cancer, its diagnosis, treatment and management through in-house and online Macmillan training.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;There\u2019s never been a more exciting time to build your career at Frimley Health, one of the country\u2019s largest and most respected hospital trusts - &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;We have three main hospitals: Frimley Park in Frimley near Camberley, Heatherwood in Ascot and Wexham Park near Slough. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As well as delivering excellent general hospital services to local people, we provide specialist heart attack, vascular, stroke, spinal, cystic fibrosis and plastic surgery services across a much wider area.

All acute services were centralised at the Lister Hospital in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, in the autumn of 2014 , placing the Trust in a position to deliver clinical services that are amongst the very best. The refurbished Lister Critical Care Unit consists of a 20 bedded facility which includes the new and expanded 8 bedded unit. The units are flexibly managed with both level 2 &amp; 3 patients and are very effectively staffed by one nursing and medical team. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent opportunities exist to gain a broad range of experience in caring for critically ill patients from many specialties. These include patients with multi-organ failure, trauma patients, obstetric patients pre and post-delivery and with both surgical and medical conditions, and patients requiring complex post-operative care following general, urology, plastics, orthopaedic and vascular surgery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the regional renal centre we offer renal replacement therapy (CVVHF) in the critical care unit and the expanding cardiac catheterisation facility provides us with patients requiring complex cardiac care via the intra-aortic balloon pump,. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We can offer an innovative, challenging and aspirational place in which to work with both units performing to the highest standards and offering unique challenges and opportunities led by a critical care matron and senior critical care nurses. In house training and dedicated clinical and professional development support is further provided by our Clinical Nurse Educator. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Working as close knit team - highly valued by our anaesthetic, surgical and medical colleagues - we are able to direct and manage patient care with autonomy and precision. Influence, respect and progression characterize the units, with all staff encouraged to be involved in decision making and all of us benefiting from team orientated encouragement, experience and guidance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We now have a vacancy for an enthusiastic, flexible and determined Band 6 Critical Care Team Leader to join our motivated, friendly and supportive team.

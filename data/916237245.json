We are excited to be able to recruit a Band 4 support worker who will work as part of the team supporting clinical staff, women and their families. The post holder will also undertake physical health checks to include ECG&#39;s, phlebotomy, side effect monitoring and other procedures as required.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Service operates across the county, with office bases in Northampton and Rushden. Women are seen in children\u2019s centres, their homes and community settings as well as hospitals on occasion. The team provides assessment and intervention to women experiencing or at an increased chance of experiencing moderate to severe mental health conditions during pregnancy and up to 12 months postpartum. The service works closely with Maternity, Health Visiting, GP\u2019s, statutory community services and 3rd sector organisations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Long Term Plan Ambitions include:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Increasing provision of services to women experiencing or at risk of experiencing moderate to severe perinatal mental health conditions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Increasing the provision of psychological interventions to women and their families&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Assessment and signposting of fathers and partners of women open to the service&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Providing specialist perinatal interventions to a number of mothers, where clinically indicated, up to 24 months postpartum&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Experience of working in the Perinatal Mental Health field is desirable as is knowledge of Perinatal Mental Health Conditions, prevalence rates, treatment interventions and Safeguarding Policies and Procedures.
